What if we make this repo *a central point for everything related to deployments* across all protocols—including the deployment scripts themselves (which means we’d need to add a `foundry.toml` file).\r\n\r\nWe’d also be installing all protocol repos (`lockup`, `flow`, `airdrops`, etc.) here via `package.json`, so we can implement a unified `DeployProtocol` script to handle all contract deployments in one go.  It doesn't mean we can't have individual scripts as well, i.e. `DeployLockup` or `DeployLockupNFTDescriptor`.\r\nOne potential problem is dealing with different deployment profiles—for example, `lockup` requires fewer `optimizer_runs`, while airdrops can use a much higher value. But we can handle this by:\r\n- Easy option: re-introduce `precompiles` in the protocols repos\r\n    -  we could refactor the `DeployOptimized` testing utils to contain the bytecode directly instead of reading it from `out-optimized`\r\n- Harder option: using different Foundry profiles as a pre-step before running the deployment script to generate the `initcode`. \r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>If we add the precompiles here</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n### foundry.toml\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[profile.lockup]\r\nsrc = \"src/lockup\"\r\noptimizer_runs = 500\r\n[profile.flow]\r\nsrc = \"src/flow\"\r\noptimizer_runs = 1000\r\n[profile.airdrops]\r\nsrc = \"src/airdrops\"\r\noptimizer_runs = 100_000_000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### script/Precompiles.sol\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/// Import to generate the bytecode\r\nimport { LockupNFTDescriptor } from \"@sablier/lockup/src/LockupNFTDescriptor.sol\";\r\nimport { SablierBatchLockup } from \"@sablier/lockup/src/SablierBatchLockup.sol\";\r\nimport { SablierLockup } from \"@sablier/lockup/src/SablierLockup.sol\";\r\n\r\nlibrary Precompiles {\r\n    function lockupInitcode() internal pure returns (bytes memory) {\r\n        return hex'<bytecode>';\r\n    }\r\n    function nftDescriptorInitcode() internal pure returns (bytes memory) {\r\n        return hex'<bytecode>';\r\n    }\r\n    function batchInitcode() internal pure returns (bytes memory) {\r\n        return hex'<bytecode>';\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### script/DeployProtocol.s.sol\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// lockup example but can be extended to include all protocols\r\nfunction run() public pure broadcast returns (address,address,address) {\r\n    address nftDescriptor = _deploy(Precompiles.nftDescriptorInitcode(), \"\", salt);\r\n    address lockup = _deploy(Precompiles.lockupInitcode(), abi.encode(initialAdmin(), nftDescriptor, maxCount), salt);\r\n    address batch = _deploy(Precompiles.batchInitcode(), \"\", salt);\r\n\r\n    // so on for all protocols contract\r\n\r\n    return (lockup, batch, nftDescriptor);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction _deploy(\r\n    bytes memory _initcode,\r\n    bytes memory _args,\r\n    bytes32 _salt\r\n)\r\n    private\r\n    returns (address deployedContract)\r\n{   \r\n    // Check to avoid deploying empty contracts \r\n    require(_initcode.length > 0, \"Deployer: initcode length is zero\");\r\n    bytes memory initcode = abi.encodePacked(_initcode, _args);\r\n\r\n    assembly {\r\n        deployedContract := create2(0, add(initcode, 32), mload(initcode), _salt)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n### Main benefits of this approach:\r\n- No need to manually go into each repo to deploy and then move all the broadcasts/ABIs/info to this one\r\n- A single source of truth for `deployments`\r\n- Scripts don’t need to be updated across all repos every time a change is made\r\n- We can fetch previously used addresses like `NFTDescriptor` without storing them in the repo\r\n- Only the mainnet endpoint needs to be configured there for fork testing, no need for all ([lockup](https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/blob/8d9a1798c502db3137b7f6947755d246868bb36e/foundry.toml#L92-L131), [airdrops](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/blob/459f8f4b0f61ae9cafa195c81894c1a9e35d4f60/foundry.toml#L89-L128), [flow](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/blob/6547ae68568359c5073ff5f19095299e0340beec/foundry.toml#L74-L113))\r\n\r\nI really think centralizing everything here is the right call in terms of maintenance costs and ease of use (deploying a lot of contracts over the past year 😆). The idea is mainly inspired by how Uniswap handles it (they have a single repo for all [contract deployments](https://github.com/Uniswap/contracts/)), v2/v3/v4/permit2 and so on, and their new [v4-core](https://github.com/uniswap/v4-core) doesn’t even contain any deployment scripts.\r\n\r\n#### Questions\r\n\r\n- If we plan to add Solana deployments as well, things could get messy. In that case, we might want to reconsider the repo name—something like `evm-deployments`—and keep Solana-related broadcasts in the `solsal` repo, as I initially suggested. (we won't have to deal with multichains there, so it makes sense to keep there).\r\n- We could also consider moving the `multichain-deployer` logic into this repo. That way, we could repurpose the current repo into something else—maybe a `multi-scripts` repo—and use it for scripts like [this one](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/90).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/evm RFF — I tried to keep my message concise here, but I highly recommend checking out Uniswap's repo. Not necessarily to do a deep dive, but just to get a general sense of how they’re structuring things and what patterns they're following.\r\n","createdAt":"2025-03-17T19:06:19Z","labels":[],"number":23,"repository":"sablier-labs/deployments","state":"open","title":"Improving the EVM deployment experience","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-09T09:53:33Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/deployments/discussions/23"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Should we use this repo for Solana too, or should we rename it to `evm-deployments`?\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/evm","createdAt":"2025-02-11T13:07:52Z","labels":[],"number":18,"repository":"sablier-labs/deployments","state":"closed","title":"Rename to \"evm-deployments\"?

The term [constant functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function) refers to a function that return the same value for all inputs. However, in Solidity, it’s used for functions like `getFee(address campaignCreator)`, which conflicts with the definition.\r\n\r\n2. Where would you put a function like `function _forbidNativeToken(address token) internal view;` ([asked here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/pull/93#discussion_r2003503578))?\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n| Old | New |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| USER-FACING CONSTANT FUNCTIONS | USER-FACING READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS  |\r\n| USER-FACING NON-CONSTANT FUNCTIONS | USER-FACING STATE-CHANGING FUNCTIONS  |\r\n| INTERNAL CONSTANT FUNCTIONS | INTERNAL READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS  |\r\n| INTERNAL NON-CONSTANT FUNCTIONS | INTERNAL STATE-CHANGING FUNCTIONS  |\r\n| PRIVATE CONSTANT FUNCTIONS | PRIVATE READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS  |\r\n| PRIVATE NON-CONSTANT FUNCTIONS | PRIVATE STATE-CHANGING FUNCTIONS  |\r\n\r\n- `READ-ONLY`: implies that the function can \"only\" read a state, be it constant or non-constant variable.\r\n- `STATE-CHANGING`: implies it changes states, but it can also read a state.\r\n\r\nSince `_forbidNativeToken` only read states, it can be placed under `INTERNAL READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS` using the new classification. \r\n\r\nAndrei suggested [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/pull/93#discussion_r2003785762) to use `USER-FACING READ FUNCTIONS` and `USER-FACING WRITE FUNCTIONS` to which I think:\r\n\r\n1. READ-ONLY is more explicit as READ is an operation that state-modifying functions perform too.\r\n2. STATE-CHANGING is more explicit over WRITE terminology.

The reason was, if any of the parameters is invalid (e.g., `totalDuration < cliffDuration`), stream creation would eventually revert. This could then notify the campaign creator who can take action within the grace period.\r\n\r\nHowever, this changes after https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/pull/77. \r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> Pointed out in Cantina audit's [finding-4](https://cantina.xyz/code/c9980035-706a-4119-91fe-7ebddaf123e4/findings/4).\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nDue to direct transfers, parameters can be misconfigured in a way that prevents stream creation but allows direct transfer.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the total duration is less than cliff duration. This would allow direct transfer if `startTime + totalDuration <= block.timestamp` but revert on stream creation. [Click](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/blob/staging/src/SablierMerkleLL.sol#L93-L110) to see the code from `MerkeLL` contract.\r\n\r\n## Auditors's recommendations\r\n\r\nAuditors have suggested to implement Lockup parameter checks directly in the constructor, and make sure all parameters are valid as per the Lockup requirements. This approach, however, doesn’t fully resolve the problem because of the non-ranged streams. \r\n\r\nTo this, @andreivladbrg has suggested a solution to assume expiry to be 1 year for non-ranged streams and run all the checks in the constructor to which I object that the claim can be made after 1 year. So, this doesn't solve it completely.\r\n\r\n## My remarks\r\n\r\nDo nothing and keep it simple.\r\n\r\nIn case of campaigns, params validation should be the responsibility of the campaign creators. Campaign creators can take action within the grace period in case of misconfiguration. By checking all the Lockup requirements in the constructor, campaign creator will pay high gas to create it, whereas the recipients will continue to pay the same cost because of the parameter checks in the Lockup. Also, it will be complicated as we will have the following checks:\r\n\r\n### MerkleLL\r\n#### Ranged streams (can be placed only in constructor)\r\n- `cliff duration <= total duration `\r\n- `startPercentage + cliffPercentage <= 100`\r\n- `if cliffPercentage > 0 => cliff duration > 0`\r\n- `total duration > 0`\r\n- `end time = start time + total duration` to make sure that end time does not overflow.\r\n\r\n#### Non-ranged streams (should be placed both in constructor and claim)\r\n- Same as above except start time can be anywhere until `max(uint40)`\r\n\r\n### MerkleLT\r\n#### Ranged streams (can be placed only in constructor)\r\n- Tranches are in order\r\n- Tranche amounts > 0\r\n- Tranche timestamps > 0\r\n- end time does not overflow\r\n\r\n#### Non-ranged streams (should be placed both in constructor and claim)\r\n- Same as above except start time can be anywhere until `max(uint40)`\r\n\r\nIMO if the end time exceed block time, from the direct transfer point of view, the logic should allow direct transfer of tokens. It is ultimately their responsibility to realize this and take action.\r\n\r\nRFC @sablier-labs/evm and @sablier-labs/frontend.","createdAt":"2025-03-16T19:27:03Z","labels":[],"number":94,"repository":"sablier-labs/airdrops","state":"closed","title":"Misconfigured campaign can revert on Lockup stream but allow direct transfers","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-03-17T18:58:00Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/discussions/94"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Context\r\n\r\nIn Airdrops v1.4.0, the tokens will be immediately released if the vesting period had already ended by the time when the user claims the airdrop.

After adding `MerkleVCA` code, the Factory contract exceeds the size limit. At 1,000 runs, it is at 29.8 kB which is 5.2 kB over the limit. Even at just one run, it is at 27.9 kB, exceeding the limit by 3.4 kB.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we are at a point where we need to rethink its design to support not only `MerkleVCA` contract but also the [new flavour of AVCA ](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/98) as well as all the new merkle airdrop contracts that we will deploy in the future.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nI've considered three potential solutions and would like to share them with you.\r\n\r\n### Solution 1: One Factory per Campaign\r\n\r\nEach campaign would have its own dedicated factory. \r\n\r\nThis is definitely scalable, but comes with migraine. We will have to maintain 4 Factory addresses. Its like going back to 3 flavours of Sablier Lockups from the singleton contract.\r\n\r\n### Solution 2: Two Factories for Two Campaign Groups\r\n\r\nWe could separate campaigns into two factories:\r\n\r\n1. One for `MerkleLL` and `MerkleLT`\r\n2. Another for `MerkleInstant` and `MerkleVCA`\r\n\r\nWhile this solution reduces the number of factories compared to Solution 1, it still comes with migraine. When we add new campaign type, additional factories would be required. There can also be grouping problem in the future as which campaign to group together etc.\r\n\r\n### Solution 3: Deploy Proxy for Campaigns\r\n\r\nSo what if we introduce proxy deployments? This would continue to allow us to maintain a single factory to manage all the campaigns. Instead of deploying the Merkle contract directly (current design), the factory would deploy a proxy contract that points to a pre-deployed campaign address. So we get,\r\n\r\n- Each campaign is deployed only once.\r\n- Only one factory is needed.\r\n- Campaign creators deploy proxy contracts via the factory, pointing to an existing campaign contract.\r\n\r\nThis solution is highly scalable.

Designed with the Superchain in mind, it automates deployments, simplifies cross-chain messaging, and enables seamless state synchronization, letting developers focus more on product and less on infrastructure.\r\n\r\n**Challenges OmniKit Solves**\r\n\r\n- **Consistent Deployment Across Chains:**\r\nManual deployments, faucet juggling, and address mismatches are common pain points. OmniKit automates deployments to ensure identical addresses and bytecode where needed, using funds from a single chain.\r\n\r\n- **Hub-and-Spoke Contract Architecture:**\r\nWhen contract logic differs across chains, keeping interoperability intact can be complex. OmniKit enables deployment of distinct bytecode to the same address with built-in support.\r\n\r\n- **Cross-Chain Messaging:**\r\nIntegrating messaging protocols typically involves deep documentation dives, boilerplate-heavy implementations. OmniKit provides clean, pre-built functions for messaging and token transfers across chains.\r\n\r\n- **State Synchronization:**\r\nReflecting state change across chains often needs custom logic and effort. OmniKit abstracts this behind a single function call.\r\n\r\n**What OmniKit Offers**\r\n\r\n- **One-Command Multi-Chain Deployment:** Deploy contracts across multiple chains using a single CLI command, with fund usage optimized to a single chain.\r\n- **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture Support:** Easily deploy distinct logic to the same address across chains without worrying about fund management or deployment scripts.\r\n- **Cross-Chain Messaging and Token Transfers:** Pre-built utility functions reduce overhead and streamline communication setup.\r\n- **Effortless State Synchronization:** Sync state across chains with minimal code and no need for custom implementations.\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n\r\n- **OmniKit Deployer on NPM:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@omni-kit/omni-deployer\r\n- **Core Library for Cross-Chain Abstraction:** https://github.com/Omni-kit/omnikit\r\n- **Examples and Integrations Templates:** https://github.com/Omni-kit/omnikit-examples\r\n\r\n**Open for Feedback**\r\n\r\nWould love to hear your thoughts, questions, or ideas on how OmniKit could be useful and improved. Feedback and contributions are welcome - let's simplify cross-chain development together.\r\n\r\nThanks!","createdAt":"2025-06-25T11:17:14Z","labels":[],"number":21,"repository":"sablier-labs/discussions","state":"open","title":"Suggestion: Explore OmniKit SDK for Simplifying

propose a collaboration between the Sablier and BuildersDAO teams to expand the concept of interest-bearing streams into a robust and flexible system of contracts. The goal, to allow users to build and configure streams that can accrue yield through different DeFi protocols, and to support varied stream types (e.g. linear, dynamic, etc.) and payout models (e.g. interest to sender, recipient, or split).\r\n\r\nI noticed a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/sablier-labs/discussions/5) around yield bearing streams from 2023, however opted to create a new discussion for this potential collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe’ve implemented a prototype wrapper contract that:\r\n- Wraps `aUSDC` from Aave V3\r\n- Mints `waUSDC`, a 1:1 wrapped token, to stream senders.\r\n- Uses Sablier Lockup to stream `waUSDC` to recipients.\r\n- On withdrawal, burns the wrapped token and converts `aUSDC -> USDC`, transferring the principal to the recipient.\r\n- Retains the accrued yield inside the wrapper for later claiming.\r\n\r\nThis has already been reviewed by @smol-ninja, however the full code and test suite can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Graph-BuildersDAO/waUSDC).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nWe’d like to start a discussion on whether Sablier sees value in collaborating on a modular, extensible interest-bearing stream system, and what your wishlist or design goals might be for something like this.\r\n\r\n**Potential directions:**\r\n- Support for all Sablier stream types (linear, dynamic, tranched, merged)\r\n- Pluggable yield protocols (e.g., Compound, Aave...)\r\n- Configurable yield routing (e.g., all to sender, all to recipient, 50/50)\r\n- Claimable yield strategies, e.g., auto-claim on cancel, claim mid-stream, etc\r\n- Sablier-native frontend tools to build or interact with interest-bearing streams\r\n\r\nWe're happy to scope, spec, and propose an architecture — but would love to start the conversation with the Sablier team to:\r\n1. Review the existing prototype.\r\n2. Sanity-check feasibility.\r\n3. Understand if there is an appetite for a generalised interest-bearing stream module within the Sablier ecosystem.\r\n4. Get input on desired extensibility, modularity, or limitations to keep in mind.\r\n5. Discuss any other integrations you had in mind that BuildersDAO can take on.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\r\n\r\n @sablier-labs/evm\r\n","createdAt":"2025-06-18T12:33:48Z","labels":[],"number":19,"repository":"sablier-labs/discussions","state":"open","title":"Expanding Interest-Bearing Stream MVP into a Modular Suite of Integrations","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-06-19T11:27:32Z","url":"https://github.com/orgs/sablier-labs/discussions/19"},{"author":"bensacc","body":"Hello, possibly this is already a feature and I just haven't figured it out, but as an organization that has started using Sablier for payroll, it would be super helpful to be able to fund all of our streams from a common pool, as opposed to invoking the 'Top Up' function for each individually.

Here are the two primary issues I've identified:\r\n\r\n1. The locked underlying assets' opportunity cost due to the inability to earn yield on them.\r\n2. The inability to leverage the voting capability of locked COMP-like governance assets.\r\n\r\nIn my research, I found that [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551) could potentially provide a robust solution to these inefficiencies. In the existing model, when a new Sablier stream is created, the underlying assets for all streams of the same type are sequestered within a single lockup contract.\r\n\r\nMy proposal entails a shift in this approach: the stream NFTs could incorporate ERC-6551, binding each stream NFT to a uniquely tailored contract designed to hold the stream's assets and dictate the lockup and release procedures of those assets.\r\n\r\nHere's how such logic could be applied to address the above-mentioned inefficiencies:\r\n\r\n**Yield Generation**\r\n1. The sender locks up the underlying into a custom NFT bound contract that initiates a constructor logic sequence which deposits the underlying into a yield-generating vault (such as by converting USDC into cUSDC), allowing the locked assets to generate income.\r\n2. The NFT bound contract also includes logic to convert the yield assets back to their original underlying form whenever the stream's recipient unlocks assets from the stream.\r\n\r\n**COMP-like Governance Delegation**\r\n1. The sender locks up the underlying into a custom NFT bound contract, which initiates a constructor logic sequence. This calls the [`delegate`](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/governance/#delegate) function, which delegates the votes of all locked assets to some address.\r\n2. The custom NFT bound contract could also have a mechanism to update the state of delegation whenever the stream's recipient unlocks assets from the stream.\r\n\r\n**Note:** ERC-6551 is still a draft in the very early stages.","createdAt":"2023-07-29T03:36:11Z","labels":[],"number":1,"repository":"sablier-labs/discussions","state":"open","title":"Use ERC-6551 to address inefficiencies in asset lockup","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-09-20T16:38:44Z","url":"https://github.com/orgs/sablier-labs/discussions/1"},{"author":"alexfertel","body":"Hello everyone!

X goes in, X goes out - with the X<sub>i</sub> tokens being more valuable than the X<sub>o</sub> (they can be redeemed for more $). \r\n\r\nWith rebasing tokens this becomes an accounting problem - keeping track of balances. Unfortunately both Aave and Compound V3 use this system for their share tokens (e.g. aUSDC or cUSDCV3).\r\n\r\n### Topic 1 - Support this type of assets\r\n\r\nWhile the v2-core itself will only support regular assets, wrapping these rebasing tokens in an ERC4626 vault and streaming the minted shares (ERC20 compliant, exchange-rate) will in theory add support for streaming e.g. `Wrapped aUSDC`. \r\n\r\nAs per this [4626 Alliance page](https://erc4626.info/vaults/) there already are a bunch of adapters written for popular tokens. If we can get some that are already audited, that's even better!\r\n\r\n### Topic 2 - Improving UX with wrap/unwrap\r\n\r\nWhile 4626 solves the compatibility problem, there's still a UX problem at hand: the wrapping and unwrapping mechanisms. Normally, a sender would have to go to etherscan or a dedicated UI to wrap their `aUSDC` in `aUSDC4626`, create a stream with the new asset, while the recipient would have to perform the inverse actions: withdraw and unwrap. \r\n\r\nFor the sender, we could introduce a new method in the target contract which does the wrapping and stream creation, similar to how the protocol periphery already [handles ETH to wETH](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/blob/2a0c05dd6413884415fd9c31223872d2b4ac8d72/src/SablierV2ProxyTarget.sol#L352). For the recipient though, the solution isn't this straightforward.\r\n\r\n### Topic 3 - Bonus: Creating special logic for yield/interest\r\n\r\nSome users have been asking for a different yield split (e.g. instead of the recipient getting the yield, it would be the sender who gets it). With some custom logic and state management this could be achieved using a special kind of wrapping.\r\n\r\nInitial thoughts on this:\r\n- a wrapper contract could store the exchange-rate upon deposit and distribute underlying funds upon withdraw based on the exchange rate at that moment\r\n- this may cause positions in the \"wrapper\" contract to be non fungible (would 4626 still be good here?)","createdAt":"2023-07-26T15:35:41Z","labels":[],"number":5,"repository":"sablier-labs/discussions","state":"open","title":"Stream yield-bearing assets","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-11-26T15:24:26Z","url":"https://github.com/orgs/sablier-labs/discussions/5"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"We should consider implementing a contract similar to Maker's [`dss-change-log`](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-chain-log).\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.makerdao.com/deployment-addresses/multi-collateral-dai-public-releases","createdAt":"2023-05-12T13:41:19Z","labels":[],"number":14,"repository":"sablier-labs/discussions","state":"open","title":"Versioned chain log for onchain integrations","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-12-23T19:52:55Z","url":"https://github.com/orgs/sablier-labs/discussions/14"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"@razgraf I remember that you added these scripts a while ago.\r\n\r\nI tried to run them on my local machine, which uses Node v16, and apparently the `--openssl-legacy-provider` doesn't exist anymore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"860\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-09 at 12 24 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8782666/194748916-27fef9fb-beee-48ad-8684-2335a915977d.png\">\r\n\r\nAre these scripts still needed?

That means only one `collectFees` per chain. No need to dig into the technical details below)\r\n\r\n## Current Airdrops Design: fee charged in `claim`\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/66\r\n\r\n**TLDR:** We store an oracle and a minimum fee in USD, then convert it to wei at claim time — both in the factory and deployed campaigns. Key points:\r\n- **Factory:** Fee can be changed freely (e.g. $0 → $3 → $5 → $3)\r\n    - Custom fees are stored in the factory\r\n- **Campaigns:** Fee can only **decrease** post-deployment\r\n    - It can be either the default or the custom fee set during deployment\r\n\r\n**Note:** with the `Comptroller`, we will have a greater flexibility, which is a plus.\r\n\r\n## Lockup and Flow: fee charged in `withdraw`\r\n\r\nIn these protocols, fees can be dynamic throughout the stream lifecycle. For example, a stream might start with a $0 fee, and the min fee could be increased later — unlike airdrops, where the fee can't be change if is zero at deployment time.\r\n\r\nTo match the airdrops approach, the initial idea was to support **custom fees for stream senders**. But there's a problem:\r\n\r\nIf a stream is **non-cancelable**, the recipient is guaranteed all the funds deposited. This makes the sender role less relevant. A user could set a sender address which has a lower (or zero) fee, so it's bypassing the default `withdraw` fee.\r\n\r\n**Note:**  This isn’t an issue in airdrops because the `msg.sender` is used to get the fee at deployment. In streams, `stream.sender` might differ from `msg.sender`.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions\r\n\r\n1. **Simplest:** accept the possible losses (similar to batch withdrawals)\r\n2. Don’t support custom fees for stream senders — only support this business model in airdrops.\r\n3. ~~Set `msg.sender` as `stream.sender` (might be consequences in MerkleLockup campaigns)~~ not a good solution, see below\r\n4. Store both `sender` and `streamCreator` in the stream data\r\n\r\nlmk if you come up with better solutions\r\n\r\nBased on what we decide here, in the `Comptroller` we would need to implement these functions: \r\n- `calculateMinFeeWeiForCampaignCreator(address campaignCreator)` - used in claim \r\n- `calculateMinFeeWeiForSender(address sender)` - used in withdraw\r\n\r\n### Other Question\r\n\r\nGiven our plan is to charge: (i) $1 on `withdraw` (ii) $3 fee on `claim`\r\n\r\nShould the `Comptroller` have:\r\n- Two variables: `minFeeUSDClaim` and `minFeeUSDWithdraw`, or  \r\n- One variable: `minFeeUSD`, set as $1 with a $3 passed in our UI for claims?\r\n\r\nSince getting the Merkle proof isn't easy for users, a single `minFeeUSD` might be enough.\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/evm @razgraf would appreciate your input.

Although, this may confuse some users and require additional information on our end. \r\n\r\nFor maximum clarity this pattern would be used only for the target contract, the core does not integrate Permit2: \r\nuser --> proxy --> target --> core\r\n\r\nRegarding using Permit2: it offers a more user-friendly experience in the DeFi ecosystem (e.g. allowing users to create streams without needing to approve if they've already done that on other platform), there is also the risk of potential loss if the Permit2 contract were to be hacked. It's worth noting that Uniswap has not experienced any such incidents in the past.\r\n\r\nCheck this [link](https://github.com/dragonfly-xyz/useful-solidity-patterns/tree/main/patterns/permit2) for a great explanation.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys say?","createdAt":"2023-02-22T19:21:08Z","labels":[],"number":13,"repository":"sablier-labs/v2-periphery","state":"closed","title":"Should we support both `Permit2` and traditional ERC-20 approvals?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-05-11T19:27:25Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/discussions/13"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem Situation\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to batch multiple function calls in one Ethereum transaction. This limitation might be lifted when [Account Abstraction](https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-account-abstraction-everything-you-need-to-know/) gets added at the protocol level, but AA will [take years](https://twitter.com/lightclients/status/1623704179737862145) to be implemented. Solutions like [PRBProxy](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy) and [DSProxy](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-proxy) have emerged as interim solutions to this current limitation of the Ethereum protocol.\r\n\r\nInternally, we have toyed with the prospect of using the proxy approach for quite some time now, but we have decided to let go of it in [a recent discussion](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-periphery/discussions/1). The rationale was that the proxy was unnecessary for the batch create function.\r\n\r\nHowever, more recent discussions have led us to realize that other features may only be implemented with a proxy mechanism, or it would be much easier to implement them with a proxy. For instance, see the discussion in https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/discussions/331 regarding stream edits, which can only be implemented in the existing contracts by having a function that batches a call to `cancel` and a call to a create function. I have recently opened a [draft PR](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/pull/337) that takes a first stab at implementing this in `v2-core`, but I have done it somewhat grudgingly. Stuffing too much logic in the \"core\" contracts gnaws away the underlying reason why we named the way we did. Composing functions doesn't sound like something belonging to a \"core\". Thus, I think we have a \"crisis of identity\" in the `v2-core` repository, and my goal with this post is to have us re-consider the proxy approach.\r\n\r\n## Feature Table\r\n\r\nSome features can easily be implemented without the proxy, others can be implemented without the proxy but require us to jump through hoops, and finally, others can only be implemented with the proxy (while still providing a decent UX to our users).\r\n\r\n| **Feature**                                                     | **Proxy**        | **Without Proxy** |\r\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- |\r\n| Function `createMultiple` (single asset)                        | ✅ Doable (easy) | ✅ Doable (easy)  |\r\n| Function `createMultiple` (multiple assets)                     | ✅ Doable (easy) | ⚠️ Doable (hard)  |\r\n| Function `cancelAndCreate` in the same contract                 | ✅ Doable (easy) | ✅ Doable (easy)  |\r\n| Function `cancelAndCreate` across contracts                     | ✅ Doable (easy) | ❌ Not doable     |\r\n| Function `cancelMultipleAndCreateMultiple` in the same contract | ✅ Doable (easy) | ⚠️ Doable (hard)  |\r\n| Function `cancelMultipleAndCreateMultiple` across contracts     | ✅ Doable (easy) | ❌ Not doable     |\r\n| Migration to v2.x                                               | ✅ Doable (easy) | ❌ Not doable     |\r\n| Migration to v3 (yes, you read it right)                        | ✅ Doable (easy) | ❌ Not doable     |\r\n| Native asset payments (ETH)                                      | ✅ Doable (easy) | ❌ Not doable     |\r\n| Permit2                                                         | ✅ Doable (easy) | ⚠️ Doable (hard)  |\r\n| Tokenized Vaults (ERC-4626)                                     | ✅ Doable (easy) | ⚠️ Doable (hard)  |\r\n\r\n## Comparison\r\n\r\nHere are the pros and cons of using the proxy approach, ordered by significance (the most significant points are at the top).\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n1. Ability to migrate streams from V2.0 to V2.x with one zap (instead of N txs).\r\n    - This is useful not just for new feature upgrades, but also for potential bug fixes.\r\n    - Long shot, but the migration may not be limited to just v2.x; with the proxy approach, migrating stream to the v3 chain via a bridge would also be possible.\r\n2. Support for native asset payments (e.g. ETH, MATIC) via `wrapEthAndDoAction` functions (see this [example](https://github.com/hifi-finance/hifi/blob/f1b338ba94b765c829117969dfa7d5cd29b4d38d/packages/proxy-target/contracts/HifiProxyTarget.sol#L518-L526) from the Hifi repository).\r\n3. Support for cross-contract interactions (e.g. canceling a linear stream and creating a pro stream).\r\n4. One ERC-20 approval for *all* future interactions with the protocol (e.g. no need to separately approve the linear and pro contracts).\r\n5. Dead easy support for [`Permit2`](https://uniswap.org/blog/permit2-and-universal-router).\r\n6. Ability to delegate the account management to a third-party via PRBProxy's [envoy<>target access-control system](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy/blob/7d5526206b4c6c11f16e7929f4c05603ead75713/src/PRBProxy.sol#L128-L135). This may be useful for automating withdrawals (a really nice solution to the problems discussed in https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/discussions/39 and https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/discussions/110).\r\n7. Solves the identity crisis problem explained above.\r\n8. Cleaner core contracts.\r\n    - The `cancelAll` function could be moved to a proxy target (the recipient would lose access to this function, but this sounds okay with me, given the benefit of a cleaner core).\r\n    - The `cancelAndCreate` functions could be implemented in a proxy target.\r\n9. The proxy would have a \"centralizing\" effect on our implementations: the `BatchStream` periphery contract would become a proxy target, and we may also be able to use the proxy approach for the [airstream contract](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-airstream).\r\n10. Using the proxy is in line with good programming principles, such as separation of concerns\r\n11. Broadly speaking, we would get the ability to add certain new features without modifying the core.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n1. Increased development time for the frontends and the subgraphs.\r\n2. Manually canceling stream would be more difficult for senders, because the proxy would be the sender of the stream. The sender would need to be a sophisticated user who knows how to ABI encode Ethereum txs.\r\n3. Higher upfront deployment cost for senders on Ethereum Mainnet.\r\n4. [Worse developer experience](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1346396518450950146) when debugging reverted txs.\r\n5. Increased audit cost due to the need to audit PRBProxy.\r\n    - This may be a moot point, however, because if we want to implement any of the features from the table above, that code would have to be audited, too. The only extra assumption would be the security of the `execute` function of the proxy itself. Still, since the proxy has many users, we would get some shared security.\r\n\r\n## Sender vs Recipient\r\n\r\nTo avoid doubt, I wish to state that the discussion here applies only to senders. It is not practical to use the proxy approach for recipients, due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- The NFT functions would become unusable.\r\n- Recipients would only be able to claim via our UI.\r\n- Recipients are typically less well-off than senders (the deployment cost of the proxy might be a deterrent for recipients).\r\n\r\n## My Proposal\r\n\r\nGiven that so many features are impossible to implement without the proxy, and others are difficult to implement without it, I am now firmly in favor of using the proxy approach.  The pros outweigh the cons. If Maker, Balancer, and DeFiSaver managed to get away with it (in spite of the cons), we should be able to do it, too.\r\n\r\n@razgraf and @gavriliumircea - I am keen to hear your thoughts on this.","createdAt":"2023-02-11T14:02:04Z","labels":[],"number":11,"repository":"sablier-labs/v2-periphery","state":"closed","title":"To proxy or not to proxy","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-05-11T19:19:07Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/discussions/11"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem Situation\r\n\r\nThe cancel function in `v2-core` can be called by either the sender or the recipient:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/3883400911f5ec3a65f7a06deb0320e1835dd5c4/src/SablierV2LockupLinear.sol#L293\r\n\r\nOn cancellation, funds are auto-transferred to the sender and the recipient. In a non-proxy world, this wasn't an issue since the sender of the stream would receive the tokens in their typical wallet. But with a proxy, this is problematic because the funds would remain in the proxy itself. This is a con of the proxy approach I omitted when I wrote https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-periphery/discussions/11.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\n1. Allow only the sender to cancel.\r\n2. Implement a page in the UI that lets senders see their claimable balance from the proxy, nothing that we might have to do this at any rate. This is similar to providing a wrap/ unwrap UI for WETH, because there can be many causes for having funds locked in the proxy, e.g. bugs in proxy targets or rounding errors.\r\n3. Write a special-purpose target contract that will be called via [`deployAndExecute`](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy/issues/62) in the BUI. This target would install a [special plugin](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy/blob/86dc90d18e6e8f92a16c6ec4dd6a97dd6d5c4a9d/src/interfaces/IPRBProxyPlugin.sol), which would implement the [`ISablierV2LockupSender`](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/main/src/interfaces/hooks/ISablierV2LockupSender.sol) interface, auto-transferring the `senderAmount` to the proxy owner.\r\n\r\n## My Thoughts\r\n\r\nThe first option is the easiest, but I am uncomfortable taking the cancel functionality away from recipients. This is in the category of permissionless \"escape hatches\" that can help prevent accidental losses of funds.\r\n\r\nThe second option would demand more development cycles from the frontend team, but it would provide our users with a utility that would be super useful to PRBProxy owners.\r\n\r\nThe third option would be the most elegant, but it would demand more effort from the contracts team. In the UI, little would change; they'd just have to call `deployAndExecute` instead of `deploy`. The plugin would run autonomously every time a recipient cancels a stream, and the funds would be auto-transferred to the proxy owner.\r\n\r\n## Your Thoughts\r\n\r\nWDYT?","createdAt":"2023-03-07T12:01:28Z","labels":[],"number":16,"repository":"sablier-labs/v2-periphery","state":"closed","title":"How to handle cancellations triggered by recipients","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-05-11T19:04:40Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/discussions/16"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"The batch-create functions will target linear/dynamic contracts.

Moreover, the app is already engineer with this flow in mind, so there's no refactoring cost involved.\r\n\r\n### Options 2: Through a proxy contract\r\nUsers will bundle their transaction calldata and send it to a (PRB)Proxy contract. In turn, this contract will direct each transaction to the correct target contract. Allowance will have to be granted only once, to the proxy, which will become the \"msg.sender\" for all created streams.

It focuses on code paths, loops, and conditions, ensuring that all parts of the code work as expected. White-box testing is often used for unit and integration testing where in-depth knowledge of the code is necessary.\r\n\r\nShould testing of a code be dependent on the internal logic/implementation?\r\n> No, testing of a code should not depend on the internal logic or implementation. Instead, it should focus on testing the external behavior of the code—this is called black-box testing. Tests should validate that the code meets the specified requirements and produces the expected results for given inputs, regardless of how the code is implemented internally. This makes the tests resilient to changes in the code structure, as long as the external behavior remains consistent.\r\n\r\nWhat is black-box testing?\r\n> Black-box testing focuses on testing the external behavior of the software without knowledge of the internal code. It checks whether the input produces the expected output without considering the actual implementation. This method is useful for functional testing and UI testing, where you are more interested in how the system behaves rather than how it is built\r\n\r\nCurrently, all Flow tests (concrete, fuzz, invariant) follow white-box testing, which means if we change an internal implementation of a function without affecting the APIs (inputs, outputs) and expected returned values, we would also be required to change a lot of tests. IMO a good testing system should test for the behavior of the system and not rely on the internal implementation of the functions.\r\n\r\nA good approach would be to have white-box testing in concrete whereas black-box testing in fuzz and invariant, though more knowledge is needed in this domain.\r\n\r\nSo, starting this discussion to brainstorm on these lines, gather resources, understand it better and eventually refactor our tests to use a mix of black and white box techniques.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n- https://chatgpt.com/share/670e4dd3-e2e8-8000-8dd2-d372b26a5761\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/engineers as it may be relevant to Solana and other repos.","createdAt":"2024-10-15T11:24:03Z","labels":[],"number":311,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Black-box testing vs White-box testing","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-05-02T14:17:32Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/311"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Do we still need this? @sablier-labs/evm\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/blob/ba0d774eeb6827e5109ae790407cdc69431e0fa6/remappings.txt","createdAt":"2025-04-08T12:41:32Z","labels":[],"number":430,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Can't we remove the remappings file?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-09T23:53:57Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/430"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"I think that the [DIAGRAMS](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/blob/staging/DIAGRAMS.md) should all be moved to the docs.

The `refundableAmountOf` returns the maximum amount that a user can withdraw, and by the time transaction is mined in the block, this amount would have already exceeded the maximum amount that can be refunded at the block timestamp (due to streaming). This makes it impossible for a user to withdraw the max amount until dealing with a paused stream.\r\n\r\n`batch` can also not be used in this case since there is no way to enter the returned value of one function as the input parameter of another.

An open-ended streaming protocol opens up new use cases such as payroll which requires a different design than what we have in v2 and Airstreams. \r\n\r\nI'd love to have comments from @sablier-labs/everybody on these.\r\n\r\nAllowing anyone to initiate withdrawal on behalf of recipients\r\n-----\r\nMotivation\r\n- Recipients will have more flexibility to choose withdrawal addresses. The address could belong to an exchange, a Safe or any crypto wallet that is not integrated into the interface.\r\n- Remove the need for all recipients to interact with the Sablier. \r\n- A recipient can initiate withdrawals through a hot wallet while using a hardware wallet as a withdrawal address.\r\n\r\nCreate multiple streams\r\n------\r\nMotivation\r\n- A new user/corporation migrating to Sablier might wish to create multiple streams at once.\r\n\r\n**Question**: Should it be implemented into core contracts or periphery contracts? If yes, should I move `depositMultiple` to the periphery as well?\r\n\r\nBroke fees\r\n-----\r\nThis feature is similar to [v2-core](https://docs.sablier.com/concepts/protocol/fees#broker-fees) where third-party entities that interact on behalf of users can charge service fees.\r\n\r\nWithdraw from multiple streams\r\n-----\r\nMotivation\r\n- Allowing recipients to withdraw from multiple streams will save gas.\r\n- Stream sender or anybody can initiate withdrawals to stream recipients for multiple streams in one transaction.\r\n- Users can show interest in Sablier UI to allow Sablier to initiate withdrawals on behalf of users. This can lead to improved user experience.\r\n\r\nAllowing anyone to deposit into any stream\r\n---\r\n[`deposit`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-open-ended/blob/main/src/SablierV2OpenEnded.sol#L179) allows anyone to deposit to a stream. It could be a useful feature for corporations where the stream is managed by one address while deposits come from different addresses (finance team, etc). \r\n\r\nOne disadvantage of this feature is if someone accidentally deposits into a stream (for ex. fat finger or entered an incorrect stream ID), those funds can only be withdrawn by the stream creator. \r\n\r\nSince this offers flexibilities for users, we can consider alternating approaches:\r\n\r\n1. The sender can whitelist addresses allowed to deposit into the stream.\r\n2. We can track depositor addresses along with the deposit. In the current model, a stream ID is specified during the deposit. If $\\text{depositAmount} \\leq \\text{refundableAmount} $, the depositor can claim back his deposit. So if someone accidentally deposits to the wrong stream, they can initiate withdrawal as soon as they realize it.\r\n\r\nThe sender deposits into a pool and then allocates to streams\r\n---\r\nMotivation\r\n- Currently, all streams created by a sender are mutually exclusive. This could lead to poor user experience when managing multiple streams as each stream requires managing its deposit. This is also gas expensive.\r\n- I propose a design where the sender can make a single deposit into a pool shared by all the streams created by him. (Inspired by Blur Pools). In Web2, this is similar to using the same credit card for multiple recurring payments.\r\n- Only the sender can get a refund from the pool.\r\n\r\nAnybody can deposit into a pool and then allocate to streams\r\n----\r\nSimilarly, anybody can deposit into a pool shared by all the whitelisted streams.","createdAt":"2023-12-08T01:04:51Z","labels":[],"number":7,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Brainstorming ideas for Flow","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-10-15T11:23:44Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/7"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"I've noticed that Flow does not have any NFTs.

Solution store the rate as amount and interval. This requires a lot of change though and probably not worth it.\r\n2. snapshotDebt is stored in decimals of the token which leads to a error/delay at each withdrawal. Solution: decrease the error/delay by storing it in 18 decimals regardless of the token’s decimals\r\n3. deciding the precision of the RPS based on the decimals of the token. Effectively you’re saying that for tokens with 18 decimals it is acceptable that they differ more from what the user wants (the incline that is) than for tokens with low decimals. This is because you’re assuming 1 wei of a high decimal token is worth less than 1 wei of a low decimal token. This assumption may not always be true.\r\n\r\nAs an example these are the values of 1 wei of each of these tokens vs their decimals:\r\n```\r\n $0,000_001                    = value of 1 wei of USDC ($1)        1e-6         6 decimals\r\n $0,000_6                      = value of 1 wei of WBTC ($60k)        6e-4         8 decimals\r\n $0,000_000_000_000_002_000    = value of 1 wei of WETH ($2k)        2e-15        18 decimals\r\n```\r\nAs you can see it doesn’t hold up when you compare WBT against USDC. WBTC has more decimals but is worth more per wei.\r\n\r\nFYI we also looked at the fact that the descaling is based on the decimals of the token as determined at the creation of the stream. If a token would change it’s decimals after creation of the stream it could cause problems. We didn’t find a way to exploit this though an any non-malicious token that alters their decimals is just a rebasing token and as such not supported.\r\n\r\n[Submission 1](https://cantina.xyz/code/99ae802b-f05c-4e36-a1d1-240d5146649c/findings/11) [Submission 2](https://cantina.xyz/code/99ae802b-f05c-4e36-a1d1-240d5146649c/findings/10) \r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n**My comments:**\r\n\r\nNote that they are assuming that $0.01 loss per ~20-30 withdrawals is not something we should dismiss, whereas we considered it to be extremely small variation and thus not realistic. Should we defend using this argument? cc @PaulRBerg  @andreivladbrg\r\n\r\nTwo solutions being proposed:\r\n1. Store amount and the interval in which it is expected to be streamed. The check if the time passed is a multiple of “intervals” and if so,withdraw the full amount leaving no precision loss to the users.\r\n2. Store snapshotDebt as 18 decimal format to minimize the difference between the actual and expected.\r\n\r\nI like the first solution as it can mitigate the precision loss entirely. Given that (cc @razgraf) users will be entering his interest in the form of “tokens streamed per interval” instead of exact rps , it makes sense to store it as it is to align with the users expectation. Thought it will be more effort and can affect our timeline for public audit and launch. We can also start a discussion out of it for for Flow’s future release.\r\n\r\nSecond solution, though, seems affordable given the timeline. But, $0.01 is too small, and I think that may still exist even after storing sd in 18 decimal format, it might end up being offering no solution. Given the fact that BTC is $60k now which can be $600k in a month and then it can end up being $0.01 loss to users even with sd as 18 decimals.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\ntagging @sablier-labs/engineers as the decision may affect users' UX.","createdAt":"2024-10-11T06:18:30Z","labels":[],"number":297,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Rustyrabbit's comment on precision issue","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-10-14T10:58:28Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/297"},{"author":"andreivladbrg","body":"As per one of Rusty’s findings: https://cantina.xyz/code/99ae802b-f05c-4e36-a1d1-240d5146649c/findings/6\r\n\r\nSince the `deposit` function is publicly callable by anyone, it means that anyone can act as the depositor for any stream.

This be calculated at the UI level and will be passed in the `create` function.\r\n- The `balance` represents the available tokens in stream.\r\n- The `lastUpdate` represents the time reference for the streamed amount calculation.\r\n\r\nThe stream **creation** and the **deposit** are **two different operations** in the payroll contract.\r\n\r\n### Create function \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/blob/93378d4d444be88d154ae42b908895d5551352c3/src/interfaces/ISablierV2Payroll.sol#L113-L132\r\n\r\nNo deposit and time arguments. \r\n\r\n### Deposit function\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/blob/93378d4d444be88d154ae42b908895d5551352c3/src/interfaces/ISablierV2Payroll.sol#L157-L168\r\n\r\nYou **can't** deposit money into the contract if there is no stream created beforehand.\r\n\r\nTo make this easy for the front-end clients, we will implement such methods as `createAndDeposit` and `depositAll`.\r\n\r\n### Withdraw sender function \r\n\r\nKinda a downstream functionality, but the amount per second is not affected. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/blob/93378d4d444be88d154ae42b908895d5551352c3/src/interfaces/ISablierV2Payroll.sol#L196-L207\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nWhen a stream is created, the `balance` is set to 0 and the `lastUpdate` to `block.timestamp`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/blob/93378d4d444be88d154ae42b908895d5551352c3/src/SablierV2Payroll.sol#L346-L354\r\n\r\nEvery time a deposit is made, the `balance` is increased by the given amount. \r\n\r\nEvery time the recipient withdraws money the `balance` is decreased by the given amount and the `lastUpdate` is updated to the `block.timestamp`.\r\n\r\n### The withdrawable amount calculation  \r\n\r\nIf no deposits were made, the function returns 0.  If the calculated streamed amount is greater than the balance, the returned value is `balance`. In all other cases, the withdrawable amount is the calculated streamed amount.\r\n\r\n### The streamed amount calculation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/blob/93378d4d444be88d154ae42b908895d5551352c3/src/SablierV2Payroll.sol#L121-L137\r\n\r\n### The returnable amount calculation\r\n\r\nThe maximum amount available for the sender to withdraw.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/blob/93378d4d444be88d154ae42b908895d5551352c3/src/SablierV2Payroll.sol#L96-L101\r\n\r\n### Helper function for sender's debt calculation (if any)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/blob/93378d4d444be88d154ae42b908895d5551352c3/src/SablierV2Payroll.sol#L109-L113\r\n\r\n### Invariants\r\n\r\n - balance >= withdrawable amount\r\n - lastUpdate <= block.timestamp\r\n\r\n**Idea**: a method that changes the `amountPerSecond` without deleting the stream entity.\r\n","createdAt":"2022-10-18T15:01:40Z","labels":[],"number":1,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Sablier payroll","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-10-01T17:56:41Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/1"},{"author":"andreivladbrg","body":"In this discussion (https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/271), @smol-ninja correctly pointed out that we can remove the [isStream](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/blob/8d0e464416b2780c784e1a86042af12faac41224/src/types/DataTypes.sol#L70) boolean and rely on a `sender` check to verify whether a stream is null.

The findings can be found in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qt8TO2UzN9rzC4Ikj2n1cViYUGXDeZpCJtSkMa78G5M/edit?usp=sharing). The data was generated using [this code](https://gist.github.com/smol-ninja/6bd1e69057795d02c33e69907da1cfc2). A similar fuzz test has also been added through [this PR](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/pull/258), which ensures that the maximum deviation and deviation are within accepted bounds which is 0.6% for deviation and 6 hours for delay (these bounds are based on the sheet data).\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n- A time interval $[t0, t1]$ is defined such that first withdrawal is made at $t > t0$ and last withdrawal is made at $t = t1$\r\n- wc = count of withdrawals made in the above time range\r\n- $rps_{18}$ = rate per second in 18 decimal format\r\n- $f$ = scale factor, i.e. $10^{18 - decimal}$\r\n- $wa_i$ = actual amount withdrawn in $i^{th}$ withdrawal\r\n- $wt_i$ = time when $i^{th}$ withdrawal is made\r\n- actual total amount withdrawn, $wa_{actual} = \\sum_{i=1}^{i=wc} wa_i$\r\n- desired total amount withdrawn $wa_{desired} = rps * (t1 - t0)$. This is what one would expect in the absence of precision error.\r\n\r\n### B-1: Stream deviation\r\nStream deviation represents how much actual total amount withdrawn differ from the desired total amount withdrawn after multiple withdrawals. For example, if a stream is expected to stream 100 tokens in 1 hour, but due to precision error, a user can only withdraw 90 tokens in 1 hour, then deviation is 10%.\r\n\r\n```math\r\ndeviation (\\%) = \\frac{(wa_{desired} - wa_{actual})}{wa_{desired}} \\cdot 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn important invariant is that $wa_{actual} <= wa_{desired}$, otherwise the implementation may lead to over streaming.\r\n\r\n_Any better solution would yield into a lower deviation._\r\n\r\n### B-2: Stream Delay\r\nStream Delay represents the time by which a stream would incur delay in streamed tokens due to precision error introduced by the divisions. In the above example, if instead of 1 hour, it takes 1.5 hours before user can withdraw 100 tokens, the delay is 0.5 hours.\r\n\r\n```math\r\ndelay(s) = \\frac{(wa_{desired} - wa_{actual}) \\cdot f}{rps_{18}}\r\n```\r\nwhere \r\n- $f$ = scale factor. For USDC, is is $10^{12}$\r\n- $rps_{18}$ = stream rps in 18 decimal format\r\n\r\n_Any better solution would yield into a lower delay._\r\n\r\n## Data\r\nThe code is run on USDC with 100,000 fuzz runs in foundry. Data can be found in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qt8TO2UzN9rzC4Ikj2n1cViYUGXDeZpCJtSkMa78G5M/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n## Findings\r\n- On `main` branch, I discovered that, for USDC, with certain RPS, over multiple withdrawals, the delay can go as high as 266 hours with an average of 4 hours. In terms of deviation, it can go as high as 50% with an avg of 0.6%. on `fix-precision`, the same numbers are very low bringing it closer to a real stream.\r\n\r\n- Before [7a80f4d1](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/pull/240/commits/7a80f4d1d5fac1be4780fde0f28b72012cbd0182), the test resulted into the failure of $wa_{actual} <= wa_{desired}$ invariant on `fix/precision-issue` which means that for some values of $rps$, the solution was leading to over streaming, which is bad. \r\n\r\nExplanation below:\r\n1. `_streams[streamId].snapshotTime += uint40(scaledDifference / rps)`\r\n\r\n```math\r\nsnapshotTime_{stored} < snapshotTime_{real} \\text{ due to rounding down by the division}\r\n```\r\n2. `ongoingDebt = (elapsedTime * rps) / scaleFactor`\r\n\r\n```math\r\nongoingDebt_{calculated} < ongoingDebt_{real} \\text{ , note that we now have a } 2^{nd} \\text{ division}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. withdrawAmount = initialTotalDebt - ongoingDebt\r\n\r\n```math\r\nwithdrawAmount_{calculated} > withdrawAmount_{real} \\text{ this is due to the subtraction with a smaller number which is ongoingDebt}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus it led to over streaming.\r\n\r\n- This led me to a better solution which not only fix over-streaming but also minimized the deviation and delay for flow streams. The implementation can be found in [7a80f4d1](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/pull/240/commits/7a80f4d1d5fac1be4780fde0f28b72012cbd0182). The solution is a simplified version of current solution and uses direct assignments which avoids multiple divisions. I will provide a formal proof of the same through a separate doc.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe difference that we thought can only be 1 or 2 can be much higher depending on the value of RPS. Thus, instead of asserting differences in the invariant, we should assert deviation and delay similar to https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/pull/258.\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n- [Explanation on precision](https://gist.github.com/andreivladbrg/b5968b8c16f5924d082dbce607f55e97) by Andrei","createdAt":"2024-09-23T07:45:05Z","labels":[],"number":259,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Benchmarking Flow implementations with Deviation and Delay","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-09-24T11:05:58Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/259"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"Recently, I've realized that there is no point in having `block.timestamp` anywhere in the code.

Even when we pass `block.timestamp`, the theoretical amounts calculated may not match because they are rounded down using corrected time.\r\n\r\nThus, I propose to go with one of the following options:\r\n\r\n1. remove `block.timestamp` from functions like `coveredDebtOf`, `totalDebt`, etc., and introduce a `time` input parameter.\r\n2.

For tokens with a lower value compared to USD (unlike BTC), this wouldn’t be practical from a gas cost perspective, as it would be too expensive.\r\n\r\nThe quickest solution to the attacker scenario from above, without adding extra complexity to withdraw, is to restrict the function so that only the sender or recipient can call it.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Inconsistency with the lockup.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Less complexity in the withdraw function.

The main issue is with \"socially unwanted debt\" (meaning correct technically, but weird for UX).\r\n\r\n### Scenario\r\n\r\n> Alice works as a contractor for 3 months, gets paid **USDC 1000**/month. Bob, the employer, opens the streams, funds it, 3 months pass and on day **2** of the new month Bob remembers the stream: no money is lost, as he only funded it with **USDC 3000** but now there's **USDC 60** in bad debt as he pauses it.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nIn order to \"stop\" a stream, one can:\r\n- as a sender, `pause` it (debt is tracked)\r\n- as a recipient, `void` it (debt is cleared)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Problem 1 - Debt dust\r\n\r\nIn organizations taking care of payroll, senders may forget to stop streams when someone is fired or a contractor finishes their commitment. Even if they do, it invites \"dust\" to accrue as unwanted debt. \r\n\r\nIn our scenario, Bob could pause the stream and go to Alice and ask her to send a `void` transaction. Realistically, this set of actions relies on a non-trivial coordination cost. While technically correct, the debt doesn't really fit with the \"social contract\", therefore causing bad UX for any accounting or portfolio tracking. The question here is:\r\n\r\nHow do we deal with the unwanted debt dust?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Problem 2 - Debt-loaded restarts\r\n\r\nPRB edit: see the [conversation below](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/197#discussioncomment-10190225).

I still wanna pay their salary, but on the 1st of next month I want that stream to stop\r\n\r\nCurrently, this behaviour can be achieved by the following (cc @andreivladbrg):\r\n1. Sender only deposits the necessary withdrawable amount\r\n2. Sender calls `cancel` after 1 month which sets `rps` to zero.

This can be automated with tools like gelato since `cancel` function can be called anytime by the sender (cc @andreivladbrg)\r\n2.

This is due to the precision error in division.  So, this raised a question for me:\r\n\r\n\"**What if we remove the 18 decimal format requirement?**\"\r\n\r\n## Now\r\n\r\nLet's say a user wants to deposit 100 USDC.\r\n- The `deposit(streamId, amount)` function assumes the input amount to have an 18 decimal format. Since USDC has 6 decimals, the user would have to pass $100 \\times 10^{18}$ as value. The deposit execution will then internally calculate the transfer amount as to be $100 \\times 10^6$ using `ERC20.decimal()`. But it gets stored as $100 \\times 10^{18}$ in the storage.\r\n- Similarly, during refunds and withdrawals, the user enters the amount in 18 decimal format and the functions internally calculate the transfer amount.\r\n\r\n## Then\r\n\r\nIf we remove the 18 decimal requirement and treat 1 token as 1 token, then there is no need to convert deposit amounts into 18 decimal format. Lets take the same example again.\r\n\r\nThe user wants to deposit 100 USDC.\r\n- `deposit(streamId, amount)` function takes $100 \\times 10^6$ as the input value. The struct object stores it as it is.\r\n- Similarly, during withdrawal and refund, the function transfers the requested amount without any decimal conversions.\r\n- For the contract, decimals don't exist anymore.\r\n- Rate-per-second is also in the absolute format i.e. if `ratePerSecond = 1000`, that means 1000 tokens are streamed every second.\r\n\r\n## Tests and Risk\r\n\r\nI tested removing all normalizations, and storing the token amounts as they are without converting them to 18 decimal format. All values were treated as absolute, ignoring decimals.\r\n\r\nThe result is that all tests passed, including the previously failing invariant test for decimal values less than 6. This approach doesn't raise precision errors due to rounding and treats all amounts in their absolute form without us making any conversions between different decimals and 18.\r\n\r\nAll streams belonging to one asset are mutually exclusive from the streams belonging to another asset. So it does not have any cross-over effects. \r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nLet me know if I am missing something. But this approach looks better to me than having an 18-decimal format.\r\n\r\nSo, I would love to know your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nPS: This does not require a big change in the codebase.

Therefore, I suggest adding another function called `depositWithBroker` instead of modifying the current `deposit` function.\r\n\r\nThe motivation is as follows: Unlike the `lockup` contracts, where the `create` function (where the token transfer happens) is called once for a unique `streamId,` here deposit might be called multiple times (the whole idea with OE is to have top-ups) for a unique ID. Therefore, to improve the DX—and since the broker param is most often set as `address(0)` and 0%—let’s have a default `deposit` function (current version) and add another with the `Broker` parameter. This way, we mentain the business improvements, by allowing other UIs to profit from our contract, without consuming extra gas for each regular top made through our app.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    function depositWithBroker(uint256 streamId, uint128 totalAmount, Broker calldata broker) external {\r\n        if (broker.fee.gt(MAX_BROKER_FEE)) {\r\n            revert Errors.SablierV2OpenEnded_BrokerFeeTooHigh(broker.fee, MAX_BROKER_FEE);\r\n        }\r\n        uint128 brokerFeeAmount;\r\n        uint128 brokerTransferAmount;\r\n        uint128 depositAmount;\r\n\r\n        if (broker.fee.gt(ud(0))) {\r\n            unchecked {\r\n                brokerFeeAmount = ud(totalAmount).mul(broker.fee).intoUint128();\r\n                depositAmount = totalAmount - brokerFeeAmount;\r\n            }\r\n            brokerTransferAmount = _calculateTransferAmount(streamId, brokerFeeAmount);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        deposit(streamId, depositAmount);\r\n\r\n        // Make here the broker transfer to keep the CEI pattern.\r\n        if (brokerTransferAmount > 0) {\r\n            _streams[streamId].asset.safeTransferFrom({ from: msg.sender, to: broker.account, value: brokerTransferAmount });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Pros\r\n\r\n1. More gas efficient for the default version\r\n2. DX improved for integrators who don't care about the Broker (most of them)\r\n3. A more minimalist API where \"andDeposit\" functions don't need to implement `Broker` param (e.g. `createAndDeposit` or `restartAndDeposit`)`\r\n\r\n#### Cons\r\n\r\n1.

By modifying this function to handle the normalization internally, users can directly input their desired asset amount, reducing complexity.\r\n\r\nCurrent _deposit Function:\r\n```solidity\r\n    function _deposit(uint256 streamId, uint128 amount) internal {\r\n        // Effects: update the stream balance.\r\n        _streams[streamId].balance += amount;\r\n\r\n        // Retrieve the ERC-20 asset from storage.\r\n        IERC20 asset = _streams[streamId].asset;\r\n\r\n        // Calculate the transfer amount.\r\n        uint128 transferAmount = _calculateTransferAmount(streamId, amount);\r\n\r\n        // Interactions: transfer the deposit amount.\r\n        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), transferAmount);\r\n\r\n        // Log the deposit.\r\n        emit ISablierV2OpenEnded.DepositOpenEndedStream(streamId, msg.sender, asset, amount);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario: A user wishes to deposit 1000 USDC (= ${1000}*10^{6}$). He will have to back calculate the normalized amount, ${1000}*10^{18}$ in this case, and use that as an input to the above function. \r\n\r\nUpdated _deposit Function:\r\n```solidity\r\n    function _deposit(uint256 streamId, uint128 amount) internal {\r\n        // Effects: update the stream balance.\r\n        _streams[streamId].balance += normalizeDecimalsTo18(amount);\r\n\r\n        // Retrieve the ERC-20 asset from storage.\r\n        IERC20 asset = _streams[streamId].asset;\r\n\r\n        // Interactions: transfer the deposit amount.\r\n        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);\r\n\r\n        // Log the deposit.\r\n        emit ISablierV2OpenEnded.DepositOpenEndedStream(streamId, msg.sender, asset, amount);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIn this approach, user does not have to do any additional calculation. \r\n\r\nNew _normalizeDecimalsTo18 function:\r\n```solidity\r\n    function _normalizeDecimalsTo18(\r\n        uint256 streamId,\r\n        uint128 amount\r\n    )\r\n        internal\r\n        view\r\n        returns (uint128 normalizedAmount)\r\n    {\r\n       // ............\r\n\r\n        // Calculate the difference in decimals.\r\n        uint8 normalizationFactor = isGreaterThan18 ? assetDecimals - 18 : 18 - assetDecimals;\r\n\r\n        // Change the transfer amount based on the decimal difference.\r\n        normalizedAmount = isGreaterThan18\r\n            ? (amount / (10 ** normalizationFactor)).toUint128()\r\n            : (amount * (10 ** normalizationFactor)).toUint128();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, all other public functions will use the same design where they accept exact amount of the asset's decimals and internally normalize it.\r\n\r\n### Advantages\r\n1. Users won't have to worry about the normalization before making a deposit. This simplies user interactions and reduce the chance of errors.\r\n2. `_normalizeDecimalsTo18` accurately represents its functionality and can be set as a pure function.\r\n\r\nWould love to have comments from @andreivladbrg and @IaroslavMazur what do you think?","createdAt":"2023-12-08T12:07:36Z","labels":[],"number":8,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Modify `_deposit` and other functions to accept the exact amount of the asset's decimals and internally normalizing it","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-05-17T15:41:31Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/8"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"<sup>Originally discussed [in this issue](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-open-ended/pull/49).</sup>\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nAs decided [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-open-ended/issues/10), we've included peripheral functions in `SablierV2OpenEnded.sol` which has resulted into [one big contract](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-open-ended/blob/main/src/SablierV2OpenEnded.sol).

We should explore a new feature where instead of manually funding each stream, the sender can deposit a total sum into a pool. This pool would then be used to fund all the streams created by the sender, eliminating the need for individual stream funding. An alternative approach could be to let Sender provide sufficient allowance to Sablier contracts which could then be used to fulfil withdrawals. \r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n-------\r\nRecently, ENS DAO [expressed a desire to pay recipients](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/rfp-stream-platform-for-ens-service-providers/18448/8) through open-ended streams, where DAO would vote to send funds to one contract which could be used to fund all the streams created by them. Our current design cannot support this as it requires each stream to be funded manually.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n---------\r\n- Reduces gas fees as it only requires one transaction to fund all streams.\r\n- Low maintenance as it eliminates the need for individual stream funding.\r\n\r\nArguments\r\n------\r\n- As pointed by Iaro, [comment](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/6#discussioncomment-7876963), and Andrei, [comment](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-open-ended/discussions/7#discussioncomment-7799411), it could create a poor user experience for recipients if the sender accrues debt. In such cases, the withdrawals would be on a first come first served basis, which could disadvantage slower recipients.\r\n\r\n- The `depositMultiple` function offers a similar experience where you can deposit to multiple streams with a single transaction. However, creating a new stream would require an additional deposit and it lacks composability among streams and modifying stream would require handling funds as well.\r\n  \r\nHowever, while these points are totally valid, for DAOs and non-retail users, who are motivated to ensure the streams always have enough funds, this could be a better design. Instead of changing our current design, we can provide it as a **feature** where senders can choose to have a single pool to fund or allowance-based funding for the streams.\r\n\r\nImplementation\r\n-----\r\nWill add later.","createdAt":"2024-01-02T12:55:55Z","labels":[],"number":21,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Single pool powered streams / Allowance based streams","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-04-15T15:35:49Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/21"},{"author":"andreivladbrg","body":"A useful feature for lockup streams is the hooks.\r\n\r\nIn the context of open-ended, I personally believe they wouldn't be that helpful since:\r\n- the product is oriented towards the sender\r\n- we don't have NFTs\r\n\r\nI am opening this discussion to see if you have other opinions.\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/solidity","createdAt":"2024-04-08T12:38:43Z","labels":[],"number":33,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Should we add hooks?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-04-15T13:18:22Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/33"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"Should there be a flag per stream that only allows the rate-per-second to be adjusted up (as in only go higher)?","createdAt":"2024-04-10T10:34:49Z","labels":[],"number":39,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Should we implement an \"higher only\" flag?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-04-16T14:10:21Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/39"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"Some users have asked us about adjusting the streaming rate (basically increasing or decreasing the amount streamed) based on some external oracle.

This makes all the streams created by a single user mutually exclusive and offers an advantage to recipients in terms of user experience.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/sablier-labs/private-discussions/discussions/6#discussioncomment-7304440:\r\n> When having two streams with the amount of 1000 tokens per month and the sender has deposited only 1000 tokens (instead of 2000 for both streams), at the end of the month, a \"first come, first served\" approach would be applied. This means that one recipient could potentially \"steal\" the other recipients' funds, which is, once again, very bad UX.\r\n\r\nThis flow prioritises experience for recipients over senders. If we were to prioritise the sender experience, then we can look into an alternative approach where the sender manages only one pool of money and all the streams created by him share the amount from this pool.\r\n\r\nFor example, a sender has a pool with 1000 USDC and creates 2 streams each of 500 USDC per month. At the end of the month, when recipients withdraw money from their streams, the balance in the pool reduces and gets transferred to each of these recipients.

This problem exists from how we write our tests:\r\n1. First, we expect an event to be emitted.\r\n2. Then, we run explicit assertions against the contract state.\r\n\r\nSince the first step checks against the emitted event, we don't get a clear indication of the actual reason for the failure.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[FAIL: log != expected log] test_WhenEndTimeNotInPast() \r\n// vs specific assertion\r\n[FAIL: total forgone amount: 7920000000000000000000 != 7919999999999999999999] test_WhenEndTimeNotInPast()\r\n```\r\nFor example, the test fails [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/blob/32ea7a58d69bd0fe752789aff3a8f121cd345948/tests/integration/concrete/campaign/vca/claim/claim.t.sol#L58), instead of [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/blob/32ea7a58d69bd0fe752789aff3a8f121cd345948/tests/integration/concrete/campaign/vca/claim/claim.t.sol#L76)\r\n\r\n*Note:* This issue also applies to concrete tests, but since they use deterministic values (pre-declared), it’s easier to quickly identify what went wrong.  \r\nIn the case of fork and fuzz tests, we use fuzzed and bounded parameters, which means we don’t know exactly what function inputs were used.  \r\nThis makes it nearly impossible to reproduce the failure scenario, as we lack a clear reason for the failure.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nI have two potential solutions in mind:\r\n1.

We recently conducted a systematic study on the causes, effects, and fixes of the inconsistent state update vulnerability in solidity. We are attempting to build a tool to detect bugs about state updates based on our findings. We have tried our prototype tool on some popular Github solidity repositories, and for your repository, we found that there are missing state updates or gas consumption that can be optimized.\n\nThe point is that when we declare a state variable in the contract, if the variable is not reassigned throughout the project, it may be a missed state update, including balance, order number, counter, contract status flag, etc. Of course, it may also be a state variable with special purposes that does not need to be changed, such as maximum supply, contract administrator address, configuration information, etc. When declaring these state variables that do not need to be changed, the _constant_ or _immutable_ modifier should be used as required, which will save gas.\n\nFor your repository, we found the following state variables that may need attention. If you are not forgetting to update them, perhaps you should declare them with the _constant_ or _immutable_ modifier:\n\n[Benchmark.t.sol](https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/blob/main/benchmark/Benchmark.t.sol)\n**State variable:** benchmarkResults\n```solidity\nstring internal benchmarkResults = \"benchmark/results/\";\n```\n\n[batch.t.sol](https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/blob/main/tests/unit/concrete/batch/batch.t.sol)\n**State variable:** newNumber\n```solidity\nuint256 internal newNumber = 100;\n```\n\nDo you find our results useful? Your reply and invaluable suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and are vital for improving our tool. Thanks a lot for your time!\n(The reason why _constant_ and _immutable_ modifiers can save gas is that they do not consume storage space within the EVM. Their values are compiled directly into smart contract bytecode, which reduces the gas cost of storage. This storage method also avoids the SLOAD operation that reads EVM storage (costs about 100 gas in EVM). The main difference between _constant_ and _immutable_ variables is that the value of _immutable_ variables can be set in the constructor, and _immutable_ variables may cost more gas than _constant_ variables. In addition, there is a slight difference in the variable types they support.

Cases of wallet hackers are out-of-scope.\r\n\r\nA recent user (Derive) has recently inquired about this possibility on Telegram:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"SCR-20250121-mqns\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e3a531c-172f-4e06-95a0-de56a949f975\" />\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- [ ] New boolean `isRescuable` (nomenclature due to be settled later) in the stream struct that allows senders to specify if they want to be able to undo the streaming.\r\n    - This boolean setting would be hidden underneath an _Advanced_ section (similar to the [optional public withdraw](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/1154) feature), and by default, it would be set to `false`.\r\n- [ ] New function `rescue` that can only be called by the stream sender to undo all streaming and rescue all tokens\r\n    - To simplify the first implementation/API, we could consider allowing this function to only be called once, and have it refund all available tokens back to the sender, and automatically settle the stream.\r\n\r\n### Nota Bene\r\n\r\nIntroducing this feature would make Sablier less trustless for recipients as they would have to trust the sender to not undo the streaming. Historically, we have argued that this is bad because it makes Sablier as a whole less permissionless. However, I would now like to argue against that view:\r\n\r\n- The vast majority of users won't click on _Advanced_, so most streams will remain non-rescuable.\r\n- Only sophisticated users who consider this possibility will use this.\r\n- Even when `isRescuable` is set to `false` (the default), recipients still need to place a high trust on the sender — e.g., they can abandon the project\r\n- At any rate, Sablier Labs will still have zero governing power over the streamed assets. So, from a legal perspective, we're as well-covered as ever.\r\n- Over the years, we have received many feature requests for this. We should listen to users!\r\n- Our competitors Streamflow and Hedgey offer this feature.\r\n- And again, fallibility is a fact.

A long waiting time for the tests to run due to a high number of API calls.\r\n2. Considerably high maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nThe above issue existed in the first place because of our current fork test structure: \r\n- We have `fuzz` fork tests instead of unit/concrete tests.\r\n    - A key factor in the long waiting time for tests to run.\r\n- We are testing the contracts against multiple tokens (and previously, there were multiple versions of Lockup contracts).\r\n    - A key factor in the high maintenance cost.\r\n    - Also contributes to the long test execution time.\r\n- Multiple time warps (with fuzzed params) which would mess up the fork setup and it complicates things.\r\n\r\n## New Proposal\r\n\r\nWhat if we implement these multichain fork tests in a more minimal way?  \r\nWhat I mean is to simply test a [happy flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path) with a minimal scenario in a unit/concrete setup, **for a single token**. Specifically, we would test:\r\n1. `createLD`\r\n2. `cancel`\r\n3. `createLL`\r\n4. `withdraw`\r\n5. `createLT`\r\n6. `renounce`\r\n\r\nWe can choose whether to run assertions or not. The important part is simply calling these functions against a chain fork to ensure they execute correctly.\r\n\r\nAnother idea, besides the happy flow, is to add `admin` tests to verify that the setup is correct across all chains.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThis approach would be useful and relevant for app integration, eliminating the need for manual testing on all chains before going live. And it would skip a step in case of bad deployments.\r\nThese tests would be most beneficial between the deployment of new contracts and the app integrating those new contracts. \r\n\r\n### About Implementation\r\n\r\n**Important**: This will most likely not be part of the current fork tests and won't be run in the CI, as it serves a very specific use case.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can add a JSON file format to store admin addresses and new deployments, which would be automatically generated using the `multichain-deployer` tool.  \r\nThen, we can simply read the data using Foundry's VM and JSON tools, similar to how we do in [BaseScript](https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/blob/835cac359e03700cfd713313991e9430d8760c42/script/Base.s.sol#L94-L98).\r\n\r\nThis approach will result in **very low maintenance costs**. See below the details block:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Example of flow</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe JSON format may vary, but let's assume `admins.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"1\": \"0x79Fb3e81aAc012c08501f41296CCC145a1E15844\",\r\n    \"42161\": \"0xF34E41a6f6Ce5A45559B1D3Ee92E141a3De96376\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`sablier_lockup.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"1\": \"0x7C01AA3783577E15fD7e272443D44B92d5b21056\",\r\n    \"42161\": \"0x467D5Bf8Cfa1a5f99328fBdCb9C751c78934b725\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the above JSON, we would have the following test:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\naddress internal admin;\r\nISablierLockup internal lockup;\r\n\r\nmodifier runMultichainForkTest() {\r\n    vm.createSelectFork(\"mainnet\"); // read from foundry.toml\r\n    admin = getAddressForChain(\"admin.json\");\r\n    lockup = ISablierLockup(getAddressForChain(\"sablier_lockup.json\"));\r\n    _; // run the test on the first chain\r\n    vm.createSelectFork(\"arbitrum\"); // read from foundry.toml\r\n    admin = getAddressForChain(\"admin.json\");\r\n    lockup = ISablierLockup(getAddressForChain(\"sablier_lockup.json\"));\r\n    _; // run the test on the second chain  \r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getAddressForChain(string memory jsonFile) internal view returns (address) {\r\n    string memory json = vm.readFile(jsonFile);\r\n    string memory chainId = string.concat(\".\", vm.toString(block.chainid));\r\n    return json.readAddress(chainId);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// a single unit test run for each chain\r\nfunction test_Admin() public runMultichainForkTest {\r\n    assertEq(lockup.admin(), admin);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI believe this approach would work well in practice, making the tests more robust and secure.\r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts, @sablier-labs/solidity.","createdAt":"2025-01-29T23:43:40Z","labels":[],"number":1164,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"open","title":"What if we implement the multichain fork tests","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-01-31T13:16:39Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/1164"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"## Problem\r\nSince the bytecode of Lockup now contains placeholders for library addresses, it has become complicated to generate the correct bytecode and use it to make deployments.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have been using a \"jugaad\" to make the tests pass which is that we've added dummy libraries addresses (which I intent to remove in https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/pull/1158) and use them in precompile bytecode.\r\n\r\nHowever, this mean that on a new chain, one would have to deploy the libraries first and then replace placeholders with correct library addresses, before making the deployment.

This was a consequence of the package tethering and the singleton. The issue consisted of having too many \"Sablier\" and \"Lockup\" words included in the string.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for making this mistake was that we wanted to maintain backward compatibility, i.e. allowing the latest version of the `NFTDescriptor` contract to be compatible with all previous releases, even though the actual SVG was not changed (just small things). But in reality, we have never updated the previous versions of the contract with the latest, and those small changes require a non-zero effort from our side. As we release more versions, the difficulty of keeping track of backward compatibility will likely rise exponentially. For example, these lines:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/9ef51a35fe0abe97fd5e4e6e93074f5212e37cf8/src/LockupNFTDescriptor.sol#L73-L83\r\n\r\nare required just to maintain compatibility with the previous wording we used for token (asset). If, in the future, we decide to rename the token to \"asset\" again (hypothetically—we can’t know for sure in advance), we will need to handle all such cases. This is just one example; there are more places.\r\n\r\nAnother argument is that the `NFTDescriptor` is at its size limit, so adding a lot of logic just for backward compatibility will reduce the potential for design improvements, as there is no more space left.\r\n\r\n#### TLDR:\r\n\r\n1. Non-zero effort to maintain backward compatibility.\r\n2. We are not actually updating the contracts.\r\n3.

To quote the [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/optimizer.html) on this topic:\r\n\r\n> The number of runs specifies roughly how often each opcode of the deployed code will be executed across the life-time of the contract\r\n\r\nThe Sablier V2 lockup contracts are \"singletons\" - they contain both storage and functionality, and are expected to be the main points of entry into the protocol. Assuming Sablier V2 is successful, the contracts will be called a great many number of times. Thus, we would ideally set the number of optimizer runs to the maximum value allowed, which is $2^{32}-1$, just like [Seaport does](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/049828e49da5e142a1a9f6cc0a725069e61e2564/foundry.toml#L14).\r\n\r\n## What we can get\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as discussed at point 8 in #279, a high number of optimizer runs significantly increases the size. Using commit [9fa613f1](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/commit/9fa613f1d826d898d216d7d880afaaf20d022cea) and setting the `optimizer_runs` config option to $2^{32}-1$, I have obtained a size of ~29kB for the pro contract, which is ~4.5kB over the ~24.5kB limit.\r\n\r\nAgain, to quote the Solidity docs:\r\n\r\n> This means it is a trade-off parameter between code size (deploy cost) and code execution cost (cost after deployment). A “runs” parameter of “1” will produce short but expensive code. In contrast, a larger “runs” parameter will produce longer but more gas efficient code.\r\n\r\n## Note about Yul IR\r\n\r\nWe are also using the Yul IR optimizer (`--via-ir`), so I am not sure we actually want to bump the optimizer runs to the maximum value possible.

Does not consolidate TVL, causing fragmented liquidity across multiple contracts. In Merkle Lockup, this isn't a problem because each claim leads to TVL increase of Lockup contracts.\r\n2.

Single contract for all instant airdrop campaigns.\r\n2. Simplifies monitoring of token flow, gas usage, unique users, and TVL.\r\n4. Allows clawback before start time or after expiry.\r\n5.

An important finding is [M-03: The caller of withdraw and renounce can skip callbacks, by sending less gas](https://www.codehawks.com/report/clvb9njmy00012dqjyaavpl44#L-01).\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/solidity brainstormed how to address the issue [internally](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/60) for a few days.\r\n\r\nNow, after some deliberation, I have come up with this new design for the hooks, which will address both the Gas Bomb and the Skipping Hooks problem.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n- Remove all hooks except the recipient hooks\r\n- Run hooks only to known, previously allowlisted contracts\r\n- The allowlisting can be performed by the contract admin only\r\n- The allowlisting is a 'one-way street' - an allowlisted recipient contract cannot be removed from the allowlist\r\n- The allowlisting is protected by a query to `IERC165-supportsInterface` method which must be implemented.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nGenerally, the point is to **meet users where they are**. So far, only the recipient hooks have garnered interest, e.g. Fjord Foundry who is building a staking contract for Sablier NFTs. We should optimize our protocol in light of this.\r\n\r\nThe design in this proposal enables the implementation of contracts that hold stream NFTs on behalf of users, such as vaults or staking contracts.\r\n\r\nThe allowlisting is irreversible in order to provide stronger immutability and decentralization guarantees. Once a recipient contract is allowlisted, integrators should NOT have to trust us to keep their contract on the allowlist. Imagine how bad it would be if our keys are hacked - the attacker could effectively freeze all assets in the staking protocol.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the `supportsInterface` method is there to preclude the contract admin from accidentally allowlisting contracts that do not implement Sablier hooks.\r\n\r\n## API Changes\r\n\r\n### `SablierV2Lockup`\r\n\r\n#### Functions\r\n\r\n- Add `isAllowedToHook`\r\n- Add `allowToHook`\r\n- Change the hooks in `_cancel` and `withdraw` to query the allowlist before running them\r\n- Remove the `try/catch` block to revert the entire tx when the hook reverts\r\n- Remove the sender hooks in `_cancel`, `renounce`, and `withdraw`\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> As suggested by @smol-ninja [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/pull/951#discussion_r1648940696), we might have to ask the hook to return the function selector in order to guarantee that the Sablier function has sufficient gas to finish the execution of the tx. I'm currently investigating this.\r\n\r\n#### Events\r\n\r\n- Add `AllowToHook`\r\n\r\n### New Behavior\r\n\r\n### `ISablierLockupRecipient`\r\n\r\n*Note: I removed \"V2\" from this interface due to the upcoming [package tethering](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/808).*\r\n\r\n- Inherit `IERC165` interface\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to prevent the following risks without compromising on decentralization. To mitigate them, we will be prudent about what contracts get allowlisted, and maintain an updated list of allowlisted entities in our docs.\r\n\r\n- Revert risk - the recipient hooks SHOULD be designed with no reverts.\r\n- If the allowlisted contract is upgradeable, the owner could upgrade the implementation to not comply with `ISablierLockupRecipient` anymore. Or they could intentionally DoS all senders.\r\n- Gas bomb risk: a contract that consumes a lot of gas could require the sender to pay a huge amount of gas for canceling the stream.\r\n- If the allowlisted contract contains a delegatecall, they can run arbitrary logic and e.g. DoS or gas bomb the sender.\r\n\r\n## RFC\r\n\r\nThis proposal enables a safe and improved hook architecture in the Lockup protocol, all the while not compromising on immutability and decentralization.\r\n\r\nKindly asking @sablier-labs/everybody and the Fjord Foundry team for comments on this.\r\n\r\nSee the accompanying PR for implementation details: https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/pull/951","createdAt":"2024-06-21T16:07:55Z","labels":[],"number":952,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Hook allowlist to fix M-03","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-09-04T17:32:32Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/952"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The problem with the `sender` argument is that it can be easily confused with the Ethereum property `msg.sender`.\r\n\r\nIn #73, I have changed the NatSpec description of the `sender` argument to the following:\r\n\r\n> /// @param sender The address from which to stream the tokens, which will have the ability to cancel the stream.\r\n> /// It doesn't have to be the same as `msg.sender`.\r\n\r\nWhich clarifies what is the goal of this argument, but I still find it confusing.

From the recipient's perspective, a \"non-cancelable\" stream that can be made cancelable again is not really non-cancelable. However, a non-transferable stream that can be made transferable may be appealing to the recipient. While the reverse (transferable → non-transferable) is not true, the transferability dimension does not affect the core distribution of assets, so disabling transferability should not be a dealbreaker.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\nBesides implementation cost, there's another significant con.\r\n\r\nThis feature would throw yet another wrench in the developer experience of making an NFT integration with Sablier. Imagine the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. Stream is transferable\r\n2. User transfers the stream to a lending protocol (e.g., [NFTfi](https://twitter.com/NFTfi/status/1696523033442443552))\r\n3. Sender makes the stream non-transferable\r\n4. The NFT cannot be returned to the original user\r\n\r\nThus, it seems like transferability would break NFT lending, and the only way to fix the resulting mess would be to implement a [locked NFT wrapper](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/684). The problem is that the spec for that is not currently settled.\r\n\r\nI suggest we do more brainstorming on this feature before assuming any particular course of action.

But since Lockup [requires end time to be in the future](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/daeac7c23942ac465fd5da5d8291ecd433326e72/src/libraries/Helpers.sol#L175-L179), we will have to change that and allow end time to be in the past as long as the following inequality holds: `startTime < cliffTime < endTime`.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE] \r\n > Even though, one-time airdrop can be unlocked with this approach, I am not against having a bespoke contract for it (see [discussion sablier-labs/v2-periphery#370](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/discussions/370)). Its a similar argument as to why we chose to release Lockup Tranched even though the same curve can also be achieved by Lockup Dynamic - gas efficiency.\r\n\r\n### Legacy Airstreams\r\n\r\nTo create the same airstreams that we allow today, we will allow `startTime` to be 0. When its 0, Lockup Linear's `startTime` will default to `block.timestamp`, making `cliffTime` and `endTime`:\r\n- cliffTime = block.timestamp + cliffDuration\r\n- endTime = block.timestamp + endDuration\r\n\r\nThis would create airstreams that begin vesting when the user claims and end at different dates, similar to the current behaviour.\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/engineers.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"356\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-19 at 12 01 10\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfa604d8-314d-4f84-b495-314ab0986030\">\r\n\r\n[^1]: Legacy airstreams are the current airstreams supported by Merkle Lockup.

The money in a Sablier stream is not actually the recipient's until the recipient withdraws.\r\n2. The money in a Sablier stream is actually the recipient's, even before any withdrawal is made.\r\n\r\nI shall refer to the 1st interpretation as the \"Conservative Interpretation\", and to the 2nd as the \"Dynamic Interpretation\".\r\n\r\nCrucially, this distinction is a psychological one. The technology is the same in both cases - it's just a question of how humans interpret it. If we're successful, this distinction might someday be statutory, in which case we will just follow the law. But we're not there yet.\r\n\r\n### The Interpretation Makes the Position\r\n\r\nThe Conservative Interpretation favors making the `withdraw` function private, while in light of the Dynamic Interpretation, making `withdraw` public makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nThus I think this is actually a debate about what interpretation we should favor internally.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n### Global Relayers\r\n\r\nA public `withdraw` function would give us extreme optionality. We would be able to:\r\n\r\n1. Withdraw money for stuck users, e.g. those who streamed money to CEX addresses.\r\n2. Offer a great UX for withdrawal automation, e.g. withdrawing for users once per month, without asking users to sign a message or make a transaction. This could potentially be done in exchange for a fee, which would be yet another source of revenues for us.\r\n\r\n### Simpler Implementation\r\n\r\nNo need for any whitelisting mechanism. The pure `withdraw` function would be able to do everything.\r\n\r\n### Scalability\r\n\r\nAssuming the Dynamic Interpretation ...\r\n\r\nThe year is 2025 and Sablier is completely integrated in most web3 wallets, including MetaMask.\r\n\r\nMetaMask now tracks all of your Sablier streams and shows up the total balance access all streams. When you wish to make a transfer, MetaMask will check what is the actual balance of your EOA and, if it is not sufficient to cover the transfer costs, MetaMask will simply call `withdraw` on your behalf on as many streams as needed (or ask one of the many public Sablier relayers to do this), so that you can perform your token transfer.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n### Taxable Events\r\n\r\nAssuming the Conservative Interpretation, anyone would be able to trigger a taxable event for any Sablier user.\r\n\r\n### Lack of Control\r\n\r\nAgain assuming the Conservative Interpretation, users wouldn't be in full control anymore. Some users might feel uncomfortable with the idea that random people on the Internet can move funds for them.\r\n\r\n### Riskier Implementation\r\n\r\nAll else being equal, a function which can be called by anyone is a more dangerous function than a function that can be called only by some users.","createdAt":"2022-07-23T10:24:27Z","labels":[],"number":110,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Making withdraw public: Pros and cons","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-06-28T19:07:09Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/110"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Costs\r\n\r\nI used this [smart contract deployment cost estimator](https://www.rareskills.io/smart-contract-deployment-cost-calculator) to estimate the gas costs for deploying our contracts to Ethereum Mainnet.

This evm version is supported by all chains we deploy to.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, we rely on `paris` version of evm for deployment. Foundry uses the value of `evm_version` to generate bytecode during on-chain deployments.\r\n\r\nSince **paris**, there have been two mainnet hardforks - **shanghai** and **dencun**. While **dencun** did not introduce anything relevant to us, **shanghai** introduced `PUSH0` - an opcode to place \"0\" on the stack.\r\n\r\nBenefits of `PUSH0`:\r\n1. `PUSH0` consumes 1 less gas compared to `PUSH1 0` making deployed bytecode smaller and reducing deployment costs.\r\n2.

Bidding dynamics. During the bidding window (which can be up to 7 days), the stream parties may withdraw assets from the stream, and so the collateral value may end up lower than what had originally been estimated by the lender.\r\n2. Cancelability. If the stream is canceled during the bidding window or once the NFT borrow has been materialized, the lender will get REKT if the collateral value had been assumed to include the unstreamed funds.\r\n3. After the bid is accepted, the NFT is transferred to an escrow contract, which may or may not be able to handle ERC-20 deposits. See more details in https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/666.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nThis is a hairy problem for which the solution is necessarily multi-faceted. Here's what we discussed on the phone:\r\n\r\n1. Create a \"locked\" NFT contract, which would wrap the vanilla Sablier NFTs. This wrapper would have an immutable `expiration` when the NFT becomes unlocked, and there would be a `locker` address with permission to unlock the NFT earlier than `expiration`.\r\n2. Add a new `locker` address in the `Stream` structs that locks the stream NFT when its value is non-zero. NFTfi doesn't like this solution because they would need to build a custom implementation for Sablier, i.e., query the `Stream` structs.\r\n3. Separate the NFT contracts into cancelable and non-cancelable (see https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/659)\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, what NFTfi requires (and any other NFT lending platform, presumably) is a way to disable withdrawals during the bidding process.","createdAt":"2023-09-08T09:15:20Z","labels":[],"number":684,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"open","title":"Issues with using stream NFTs as collateral for lending","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-05-11T20:39:32Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/684"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"Given we now have generic `createWithTimestamps` methods instead of the old variations (durations, deltas, ranges, milestones), shouldn't we rename the dedicated LockupLinear parameter for start / cliff / end from `range` to `timestamps` in the create method (and the `DataType` itself)?\r\n\r\nCC: @sablier-labs/solidity ","createdAt":"2024-03-29T18:16:25Z","labels":[],"number":902,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Rename \"range\" data types to \"timestamps\"","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-04-30T16:24:44Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/902"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"- Benefits: see Fjord's feedback below\r\n- Cons: increased gas cost\r\n\r\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/assets/8782666/e6978dc9-4899-49d9-9add-be939dda894b\"/>\r\n\r\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"SCR-20240425-sgul\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/assets/8782666/c85aa49a-d3cb-40e3-8d54-36654e83a975\">","createdAt":"2024-04-25T20:05:49Z","labels":[],"number":909,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Include the chain ID and the Lockup model in the ID itself","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-04-28T14:05:05Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/909"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"During our call with Rusty (from Cantina), he suggested us to avoid using `ffi` for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- Enabling `ffi` allows executing any arbitrary command during foundry tests.

You can find a complete exposition of my rationale [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/private-discussions/discussions/4), but, in short, the issue is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1. The unlock-in-step curve is one of the payment options available on our official UI. Unlocking in steps is not streaming, so this is a case of cognitive dissonance on our part (I have been saying this [since we launched V2](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/discussions/140#discussioncomment-6304651)).\r\n2. People are using `LockupDynamic` for timelocks[^1][^2], i.e., \"streams\" in which the payout looks like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/assets/8782666/355eee50-9be5-4fba-b2f7-9d44f1ffbb53\"/>\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRename the [`_streams` mapping](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/6189bbc099d1d5fc50b62b93fd9a5fcfbadd7144/src/SablierV2LockupDynamic.sol#L63) to something else, as well as all semantically related references.\r\n\r\nMy suggestions:\r\n\r\n- `payments`\r\n- `plans`\r\n- `agreements`\r\n- `accords`\r\n- `covenants`\r\n- `schedules`\r\n- `flows`\r\n\r\nAlthough I will admit that I don't particularly like any one of these options, for instance, \"payments\" would be confusing because a settled stream may be composed of multiple withdrawals (the recipient may have withdrawn multiple times). And so you end up with a \"payment of payments\".\r\n\r\nWDYT @andreivladbrg, @razgraf?\r\n\r\n## Off-shoots\r\n\r\nThere are several consequences downstream, e.g., the `streamingBalanceOf` function would have to be replaced by `availableBalanceOf` (or something like that).

Any contract that is deployed on L1 can be directly deployed to Blast without making any change but that would also not allow the contract to re-configure the yield mode in the future.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nabstract contract SablierV2Base {\r\n    IBlast public constant BLAST = IBlast(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000002);\r\n\r\n    constructor(....) {\r\n        ....\r\n        // subscribe to Void mode. \r\n        // the set `governor` address can re-configure yield mode after contract creation.\r\n\tBLAST.configure({ _yield: YieldMode.VOID, gasMode: GasMode.VOID, governor: 0x123...678 });\r\n        ....\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Automatic\r\nWhen a smart contract is subscribed to Automatic mode, any ETH or stablecoin deposited earns yield automatically. Blast uses the rebase approach to reflect yield in the balance.\r\n\r\n_For example, a smart contract has 10 ETH and after 24 hours, it earns 0.1 ETH, Blast will automatically change its balance from 10 ETH to 10.1 ETH. This is also reflected in ERC20's `balanceOf`._\r\n\r\nSince Sablier streams don't use `balanceOf`, it would require something similar to [implementing a recovery mechanism](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/11) in order to withdraw the excess yield amount added to its balance.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nabstract contract SablierV2Base {\r\n    constructor(....) {\r\n        ....\r\n        // subscribe to Automatic mode\r\n        // the set `governor` address can re-configure yield mode after contract creation.\r\n\tBLAST.configure({ _yield: YieldMode.AUTOMATIC, gasMode: GasMode.VOID, governor: 0x123...678 });\r\n        ....\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## 3. Claimable\r\nIn this mode, a smart contract earns yield automatically without requiring its balance to rebase and accumulating yield separately. **The governor address claims yield on behalf of the contract.**\r\n\r\n_For example, if 10 ETH is deposited, the contract balance will remain at 10 ETH always. The accrued yield balance of 0.1 ETH can be claimed separately._\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nabstract contract SablierV2Base {\r\n    constructor(....) {\r\n        ....\r\n        // subscribe to Claimable mode\r\n        // the set `governor` address can re-configure yield mode after contract creation.\r\n\tBLAST.configure({ _yield: YieldMode.CLAIMABLE, gasMode: GasMode.VOID, governor: 0x123...678 });\r\n        ....\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Governor {\r\n    // to claim yield on behalf of the contract when its subscribed to Claimable mode.\r\n    BLAST.claimYield(address contractAddress, address recipientOfYield, uint256 amount) external returns (uint256);\r\n    // to re-configure yield mode after contract creation\r\n    BLAST.configureContract(address contractAddress, YieldMode _yield, GasMode gasMode, address governor) external;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### My remarks\r\nBlast deployment doesn't require much work. We can deploy the contracts with Claimable mode in the beginning as it keep the yield separate from the main contract balance, and then later figure out what to do with the yield.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n1.

I've been working on implementing the new Sablier streaming model, i.e. [LockupTranched](https://github.com/andreivladbrg/v2-tranched), it reminded my self  how much duplicated logic exists between `LockupLinear` and `LockupDynamic` contracts.\r\n\r\nThis thing is caused by the different `Stream` ([LD](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/ea6f097d417eee2e0aa2568b4f18cbd2b2f65613/src/types/DataTypes.sol#L166-L182),[LL](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/ea6f097d417eee2e0aa2568b4f18cbd2b2f65613/src/types/DataTypes.sol#L266-L281)) data structures stored in the contracts:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/ea6f097d417eee2e0aa2568b4f18cbd2b2f65613/src/SablierV2LockupDynamic.sol#L62\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/ea6f097d417eee2e0aa2568b4f18cbd2b2f65613/src/SablierV2LockupLinear.sol#L50\r\n\r\nAs we plan to implement multiple models of `Lockup` contracts in the future, this issue will increasingly cause more harm, in terms of dev work time, maintenance, and ofc more prone to errors (as we discussed here https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/771 - also, we would not need to implement that \"code identity\" test) and I don't think we should leave it as it is.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n**Note:** I've already implemented the changes on this [branch](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/tree/major-refactor). \r\n\r\nGiven that the structs share more than 90% of the variables, it was inevitable to find a solution by adding a new data structure within the `Lockup` namespace. This structure will be used in all child contracts of `SablierV2Lockup`.\r\n\r\nSo the design I am proposing is:\r\n- All lockup contracts share a common `Stream` entity and it is going to be placed in `SablierV2Lockup`\r\n- Each model has the ability to add new data structures to store in their unique implemention\r\n    - For linear model the new type is going to be cliffs: `mapping(uint256 id => uint40 cliff) internal _cliffs;`\r\n    - For dynamic model the new type is going to be the segments: `mapping(uint256 id => LockupDynamic.Segment[] segments) internal _segments;`\r\n-  All streams will still share the same id (similar to how we get the recipient - it is stored in the owners mapping from `ERC721`)\r\n- The child contracts will only implement the `create` functions and the calculation function: `_calculateStreamedAmount`\r\n- The API remains the same, meaning that `getStream` function will return the same data structure as the current version, but this one is [going to be built in the view function](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/648f55a21f73686eff5a06c45eeab371a172348b/src/SablierV2LockupLinear.sol#L94-L121)\r\n\r\nThe only downside I can think of is the gas implications in the `create` function, this design will require one more `mapping`. \r\n\r\nI've performed a [benchmark](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/tree/648f55a21f73686eff5a06c45eeab371a172348b/test/benchmark) and this is the result:\r\n\r\n**Later edit:** the gas costs are increased in the linear contract only when there is a [cliff linear curve](https://docs.sablier.com/concepts/protocol/stream-types#cliffs) stream created. when there is a [simple linear](https://docs.sablier.com/concepts/protocol/stream-types#lockup-linear) stream, no gas increases (benchmarked at 116052).\r\n\r\n| Contract      | Current gas cost | Proposed design gas cost | Increased by | \r\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| LockupLinear      |   116184    | 138073| 21889 |\r\n| LockupDynamic   | 182841  |182967| 126 |\r\n\r\n**Note:** the gas costs are for the `createWithTimestamps` function and in dynamic contract 2 segments were used.\r\n\r\nIn the linear contract, there is indeed a significant difference, due to the introduction of a new storage slot. In the dynamic contract, there is not a significant difference because the segments were already located at the end of the stream struct.\r\n\r\nDespite the increase in gas, I believe that this refactor is the right choice to make. The code reduction amounts to almost [300 lines](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/commit/9d140641bc876f0fa32b94591c37b6c28c001c00) lines in the `src` dir. If we were to add `Tranched`, we would have even greater improvement. \r\n_It is a more robust and a much cleaner design._\r\n\r\n### ~Other consideration~\r\n\r\n**Later edit:** as per my comment below, this consideration is not needed anymore because we would leave cliff = 0 in simple linear sterams.\r\n\r\nSince the only unique thing in the linear stream is the `cliff time` variable, and we can achieve the same feature in the dynamic contract with a 2-segment stream, we can consider removing the [cliff streaming curve](https://docs.sablier.com/concepts/protocol/stream-types#cliffs) for linear streams. In this case, the only curve achievable by this contract would be:\r\n<img width=\"313\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/assets/99738872/076ff25e-826e-4596-b1a4-af59e5e176d8\">\r\n\r\nThis approach would allow us to maintain the same gas cost as the current version or even slightly reduce it due to the removal of the `cliffTime`. However, before making this decision, we should make a query on Dune for lockup linear contracts to see how frequently [this curve](https://docs.sablier.com/concepts/protocol/stream-types#cliffs) is used. Also, we need to see what's the impact at the app level.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very curious about your opinion @PaulRBerg @smol-ninja. \r\nYou can view the work [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/tree/major-refactor).\r\n","createdAt":"2024-01-26T13:41:19Z","labels":[],"number":805,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Refactor lockup contracts to move all common logic in `SablierV2Lockup`","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-01-31T14:46:36Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/805"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The task is to rename the `renounce` functionality (the function name, the event, etc.) to `disableCancelability`.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1.

They presented us with some valuable feedback on the lifecycle of the token and how to possibly improve its DX.\r\n\r\n### Assumption\r\n\r\nIn the current design, the discussion revolved around burning the token (#129) as soon as the stream reaches an end state.\r\n\r\n### New perspective (technical)\r\n\r\nTo support our Sablier v2 NFT, their protocol would implement a special wrapper (a `wNFS` if you may, as in \"_wrapped non fungible stream_\"). The fact that canceling is a hard-to-predict action (sender may choose when [if stream is cancelable]) would force the integrator to code special logic to host not only an ERC721 but ERC20s too, inside the wrapper. This is because, upon cancelation, the owner of the token would have to expect funds being sent into their balance. The owner/recipient here would be the wrapper itself, **hence the need for custom logic**.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution consisted of creating a new **end state** that comes into play after the stream gets canceled. Instead of burning the NFT, the `cancel` action would move the idle/non-streamed funds back to the sender, while the ones that haven't been redeemed yet would remain in the custody of the NFT itself. This would actually make `withdraw` the only case when, upon asking to redeem 100% of the available funds would cause the stream to move into an end state and possibly be burned.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New perspective (economical)\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not financial advisors and tax is subjective to our user's own research and jurisdiction, in a borrowing context, leaving the funds locked into the NFT could prove beneficial for its owner. As borrowing is usually not a taxable event, the user could choose to leave their funds idle in the token contract (delaying the final withdrawal) and borrow against it even though the stream itself may have stopped a long time ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TL;DR;\r\n\r\n- Token should not be burned on `cancel`\r\n- Token could be burned only on the final `withdraw` (no more value inside)\r\n- In the context of integrations, any other action that's not in the full control of the recipient should be considered with extra care\r\n- Keeping the NFT alive (for as long as it can theoretically hold value) maybe prove to be tax advantageous\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2022-10-29T20:09:27Z","labels":[],"number":150,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Delay re-routing funds upon a stream getting canceled","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-01-08T16:41:30Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/150"},{"author":"viraj124","body":"We have built a fractionalizer as a usecase for the vesting nft's where instead of having 1 nft that is created upon vesting users can  vest small amounts and thus have multiple vesting nft and can use the fractionalizer to get fungible tokens based on the value of the underlying token their vesting nft holds.\r\n\r\nusers interact through our [ocean protocol](https://wiki.shellprotocol.io/how-shell-works/the-ocean-accounting-hub) which is a common accounting layer for all our primitives and swap the nft for fungible tokens and vice versa","createdAt":"2024-01-06T07:32:41Z","labels":[],"number":782,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"open","title":"Vesting NFT fractionalizer with Shell Protocol","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-01-08T11:33:42Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/782"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Pnpm has compatibility issues because of the way it caches the dependencies in `node_modules/.pnpm`:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5307#issuecomment-1859191327\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/508#discussioncomment-7751667\r\n\r\nWe should look into alternatives, and Bun looks promising:\r\n\r\nhttps://bun.sh/package-manager","createdAt":"2023-12-18T14:20:56Z","labels":[],"number":754,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Use Bun instead of Pnpm","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-12-31T12:26:46Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/754"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Context\r\n\r\nI did some research this morning on the status quo of invariant/fuzz testing in Solana, and unfortunately I have bad news to share.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> A note about terminology: I use 'fuzzing' and 'invariant' interchangeably.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nThere is little to no support for fuzzing/invariant testing in Solana.\r\n\r\n[Trident](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident) is the only framework that provides fuzzing/invariant testing for Solana programs. Sadly, [it doesn't support Anchor v0.31 and Solana v2.1](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident/issues/353), and it also struggles to compile on macOS Silicon due to its dependency on [honggfuzz](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz/issues/477).\r\n\r\nOne of its maintainers [told](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident/issues/352#issuecomment-3139616009) me that in the next release, they will drop the hard dependency on `honggfuzz`, although that will involve writing more code on our end.\r\n\r\n## What to Do?\r\n\r\nI see two potential solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Work with Trident, scrappy as it is. Aggressively open GitHub issues and pressure the Trident maintainers to add support for Anchor v0.31 and macOS Silicon (I've already started doing this). If this approach doesn't pan out, use desktop software like Parallels Desktop to develop on Ubuntu.\r\n2. Build a fuzzing/invariant engine in TypeScript.  A property-based testing framework like [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check) might be useful (but I'm not sure, this conjecture should to validated when development is started).\r\n\r\nI am slightly more inclined to go with option 1.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [What is the equivalent of Foundry's invariant testing in Solana?](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/22990/what-is-the-equivalent-of-foundrys-invariant-testing-in-solana)\r\n- [Professional workflow for Anchor Tests](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/21115/professional-workflow-for-anchor-tests)\r\n\r\nAnd somewhat tangential .. it looks like in Solana, it is not even possible to generate test coverage reports:\r\n\r\n- [Solana program test coverage](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/5880/solana-program-test-coverage)\r\n- [How to measure test coverage for Anchor program?](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/2610/how-to-measure-test-coverage-for-anchor-program)\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/solana","createdAt":"2025-07-31T12:11:52Z","labels":[],"number":225,"repository":"sablier-labs/solsab","state":"open","title":"A report on fuzzing/invariant testing in Solana","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-08-04T12:22:48Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/discussions/225"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"I was thinking about how we currently emit errors:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/blob/ec9c546a511241f3b1c42ef6244b6709ce3abca1/programs/lockup/src/utils/validations.rs#L13-L17\r\n\r\nWhat will Solana users see on a blockchain explorer like SolScan?\r\n\r\nWill they see `StreamDepleted`, or the error's numerical code?\r\n\r\nI'm asking because I am thinking about potentially namespacing the errors with the program name, e.g., `SablierLockup_StreamDepleted`.\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/solana","createdAt":"2025-07-29T16:18:22Z","labels":[],"number":222,"repository":"sablier-labs/solsab","state":"closed","title":"Namespacing error names with the program name","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-07-31T11:52:24Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/discussions/222"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"@sablier-labs/solana\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/blob/ec9c546a511241f3b1c42ef6244b6709ce3abca1/programs/lockup/src/instructions/withdraw.rs#L54-L63","createdAt":"2025-07-29T16:12:08Z","labels":[],"number":220,"repository":"sablier-labs/solsab","state":"closed","title":"What happens when the NFT is burned?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-07-31T11:55:21Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/discussions/220"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"@sablier-labs/solana\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/blob/bba5c892c67518c55073f669573bb735fc36059a/programs/lockup/src/state/lockup.rs#L27-L31","createdAt":"2025-07-24T11:11:27Z","labels":[],"number":190,"repository":"sablier-labs/solsab","state":"closed","title":"Why are the timestamp values `i64` and not `u64`?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-07-25T14:29:58Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/discussions/190"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"@sablier-labs/solana\r\n\r\nThey will be auto-generated (I suppose), so give us more homework by appending them as comments, e.g. here?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/blob/bba5c892c67518c55073f669573bb735fc36059a/programs/lockup/src/utils/errors.rs#L7","createdAt":"2025-07-24T14:51:37Z","labels":[],"number":201,"repository":"sablier-labs/solsab","state":"closed","title":"What's the point of appending the error codes hex values in the Rust code?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-07-25T08:41:28Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/discussions/201"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"@sablier-labs/solana, could you please explain what the safety buffer is?\r\n\r\nThis looks like 0.001 SOL.

There are a few solutions we can brainstorm around.\r\n\r\n*Note:* The EVM design involves having a stored minimum fee that is less than the actual fee paid by the end user. For example, the min fee is $1, but the actual fee paid in the app for `claim` is $3.\r\n\r\n## First solution\r\n\r\nAdd a `fee_amount` parameter in the instruction that requires a fee to be paid, i.e. `claim` and `withdraw`.\r\nThis amount will be checked against the stored minimum fee, and if it is less, the `tx` is reverted. \r\n\r\n**Cons:** It might feel unnatural to pass a fee amount in the `withdraw` and `claim` functions.  \r\n**Pros:** Everything is in one place, and the total fee of $3 will be clearly visible in the explorer.\r\n\r\n## Second solution\r\n\r\nTransfer the minimum SOL amount ($1) from the user in `withdraw` or `claim`, and then implement a new instruction that takes an additional amount as input. In the case of `claim`, this would be $2, which gets transferred from the user and then from the caller to the treasury. This requires a batch of instructions. (I still need to research this, but Iaro told me that they are atomic)\r\n\r\n**Cons:** Split fees — $1 in one instruction, $2 in another — and potentially more work in the app.  \r\n**Pros:** `withdraw` and `claim` don’t require an awkward parameter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Related question\r\n\r\nShould the min fee in Solana be a constant or should it be editable?  \r\nIf it’s a constant, things would be much simpler since we wouldn’t need to create another account to store its state.\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/solana What do you think?

Thus, some of the ideas might or might not be compatible with how Anchor works.\r\n\r\nCongrats on the great work so far @IaroslavMazur.\r\nIn this discussion, I want to _brainstorm_ some ways to structure and build Solana programs in a robust way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAssuming that we will have a pseudo “monorepo” for the Solana programs, i.e. all of the projects we have in Solidity (`lockup`, `airdrops`, and `flow`) we would place them under this repo. (ofc, not in the first version just talking about long term)\r\n\r\nHere is my recommendation:\r\n\r\n```tree\r\nprograms\r\n├── airdrops\r\n│   ├── Cargo.toml\r\n│   └── src\r\n├── flow\r\n│   ├── Cargo.toml\r\n│   └── src\r\n└── lockup\r\n    ├── Cargo.toml\r\n    └── src\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a unique dir for each project, with its individual configuration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIdea for structuring the `src`. This can be applied to each dir mentioned above.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I see that all logic is placed under the `lib.rs` and `utils.rs` files, which IMO can be improved.\r\n\r\nTo create a structure similar to Solidity contracts (making it easier for someone familiar with our codebase to see other projects) and at the same time, maintain a familiar environment for Solana, I suggest the following structure:\r\n\r\n```tree\r\n└── src\r\n    ├── instructions\r\n    ├── state\r\n    └── utils\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The `instructions` dir should contain files for each function, with their instruction implementations\r\n- The `state` dir is intended for structs that are stored in storage/state, i.e. [these ones](https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/blob/d9185ab63a0473667aa2c7d4bb8d6e824982724b/programs/sablier-on-solana-ts/src/lib.rs#L419-L442).\r\n  It would be equivalent to [types dir](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/staging/src/types/) in Solidity, but without parameter structs, as we don’t seem to need them.\r\n- The `utils` dir should contain various utility files\r\n\r\nFor the lockup example, the structure would look like this:\r\n\r\n```tree\r\nprograms/lockup/src/\r\n├── instructions\r\n│   ├── cancel.rs\r\n│   ├── createLL.rs\r\n│   └── withdraw.rs\r\n├── lib.rs\r\n├── state\r\n│   └── structs.rs\r\n└── utils\r\n    ├── errors.rs\r\n    ├── helpers.rs\r\n    └── math.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@IaroslavMazur I am curious about your thoughts on these ideas.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have any other suggestions, please share them.\r\n\r\nIf we are going to implement some of these changes, I would like to work on them to (i) review the code and (ii) become more familiar with Solana development, if that's ok.\r\n","createdAt":"2025-01-14T21:37:01Z","labels":[],"number":5,"repository":"sablier-labs/solsab","state":"closed","title":"Ideas to restructure the programs dir","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-01-25T15:44:08Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/discussions/5"},{"author":"IaroslavMazur","body":"Floating point is supported natively in Rust (e.g. `f32` and `f64` number types), but it’s not deterministic (e.g. the result of the operations may depend on the hardware the compiler is running on).\r\n\r\nTherefore, because blockchain require math operations to be deterministic (such that the different nodes trying to reach consensus could, actually, do this), the above types, while, theoretically, available for use on Solana, are not recommended.\r\n\r\nThe most popular Rust crates for fixed point math appear to be [rust_decimal](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal) and [fixed](https://crates.io/crates/fixed).\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/solana ","createdAt":"2025-01-21T16:27:17Z","labels":[],"number":9,"repository":"sablier-labs/solsab","state":"closed","title":"Fixed point math on Solana","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-01-24T15:43:05Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/discussions/9"},{"author":"IaroslavMazur","body":"While “9” is the most common answer I’ve seen, there doesn’t seem to be any widespread consensus regarding this.\r\n\r\nAsked [this question on SE](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/19223/is-there-a-standard-for-token-decimals-on-solana-like-ethereums-18) to, hopefully, settle this matter.\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/solana ","createdAt":"2025-01-21T16:26:38Z","labels":[],"number":8,"repository":"sablier-labs/solsab","state":"closed","title":"Token decimals standards on Solana (are there any?)","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-01-24T09:06:15Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab/discussions/8"},{"author":"IaroslavMazur","body":"Generally speaking, aside from Rent (paid once, at account creation), there are are just 2 types of fees: \r\n- Tx fees (i.e. “gas fees”) and\r\n- Prioritization fees\r\n\r\nWhile the “base” Tx fee is currently set at 5k lamports per signature (subject to change in the future), the Prioritization fee goes up proportionally to the use of the chain bandwidth.\r\n\r\nAkin to the other blockchains, Solana limits the total amount of Compute Units (i.e. “EVM gas”) that can fit inside a block (48M CUs).\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike the other chains, Solana also limits how much CUs each account can use in a block (12M CUs).\r\n\r\nNow, the “Localized fee markets” are not, actually, a separate kind of fee or something.

The milestones flavor uses the segment properly, by accessing all variables, including milestones. The deltas flavor won't use milestones **at all**. Instead, it will make use of an additional method argument called `deltas[]` where it will source its durations from.\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\nBy reusing the segment struct we're causing a few headaches to any developer reading the interface:\r\n - `milestones` isn't being used at all in the delta variant (we ask for a redundant value)\r\n - the assumption of an array with segment definitions is broken, as now we're back to multiple different data sources defining a segment (which now have to be synced)\r\n\r\nI propose we implement two separate structs, one including a milestone, the other a duration. \r\nAs an alternative (although I hope we can have distinct structs), we can discuss the possibility of having a single struct that either re-uses a time dimension (e.g. `lifetime`) but means different things based on the variant chosen -- which is still bad UX but might save up on gas.\r\nAs a second alternative, we revert back to the separate arrays, although I think that was more gas/storage intensive.\r\n\r\n## Problem no. 2 - Order of arguments\r\n\r\nThe linear methods follow an order: `sender, recipient, total, asset, cancelable, [...special...], broker`\r\nThe dynamic methods have: `sender, recipient, total, [...special...], asset, cancelable, [...special...], broker`\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be best to group these similar arguments together, by moving asset and cancelable after the total amount?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem no. 3 - Deltas vs Durations and Milestones vs Ranges\r\n\r\nFor consistency, why don't we use durations and ranges for both contracts? At least with milestones I can understand that we're naming the method after the specific `milestone` field of the segment struct, that's driving the temporal logic here. Instead of range, which would work too.\r\n\r\nBut deltas vs. durations feels a bit redundant.

The techniques aim at creating a tree structure that can explain test case scenarios even to a non-technical person. A simple example:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Integration_test {\r\n  function test_RevertWhen_Null() external {...}\r\n  \r\n  modifier whenNotNull() {...}\r\n  \r\n  function test_GetSegments() external whenNotNull {...}\r\n}\r\n```\r\ncan be represented by the following tree structure.\r\n```tree\r\n├── when the id references a null stream\r\n│  └── it should revert\r\n└── when the id does not reference a null stream\r\n   └── it should return the correct segments\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two keywords to specify the states: `When` for function parameters and `Given` for contract states. As in the above example, `Null` is a functional parameter condition represented by the `When` keyword. \r\n\r\nIn a more complicated scenario such as\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction test_RevertWhen_DelegateCalled {}\r\n\r\nfunction test_RevertWhen_AmountTooHigh() external whenNotDelegateCalled {}\r\n\r\nfunction test_RevertWhen_AssetNotFlashLoanable() external whenNotDelegateCalled whenAmountNotTooHigh {}\r\n```\r\nwhere `DelegateCalled` is technically not a contract state but a mode of execution, it becomes hard to categorize this into `When` and `Given`.\r\n\r\nIf we use `Given` for `DelegateCalled`, we can also use `RevertGiven` instead of `RevertWhen` for it but `RevertWhen` sounds friendlier as a function name while `Given` can be more appropriate as a modifier's name. (_Given this, Revert when_)\r\n\r\nIt, thus, can be refactored as the following: \r\n```solidity\r\nfunction test_RevertWhen_DelegateCalled {}\r\n\r\nfunction test_RevertWhen_AmountTooHigh() external givenNotDelegateCalled {}\r\n\r\nfunction test_RevertWhen_AssetNotFlashLoanable() external givenNotDelegateCalled givenAmountNotTooHigh {}\r\n```\r\nThis improves the readability of the tree structure in line with the naming convention used for function names, but brings in inconsistencies in the use of `Given` and `When` to specify states. Have a look at the below tree structure:\r\n\r\n```tree\r\n├── when delegate called\r\n│  └── it should revert\r\n└── given delegate not called\r\n│  └── when amount too high\r\n│     └── it should revert\r\n│  └── given amount not too high\r\n│     └── when asset not flash loanable\r\n│          └── it should revert\r\n│     └── when asset flash loanable\r\n│          └── it should not revert\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe goal of this discussion is to find the best approach for using English keywords to build a tree structure so that it can be automated with the naming conventions of the test functions.","createdAt":"2023-08-04T18:15:07Z","labels":[],"number":647,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Best practices for Branching Tree Technique (BTT)","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-09-23T14:21:39Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/647"},{"author":"scorpion9979","body":"As the protocol moves closer to public release, it may be beneficial to include an \"Architecture\" section in the README.

Scales\r\n2. Remains readable at scale\r\n \r\nV1 did not scale, because Forge enforces a limit on how large a contract name can be (`os error 63`), and it also wasn't very readable at scale, due to the long contract names. Whereas V2 scaled, in that Foundry could run the tests even with very long function names, but again the readability wasn't great.\r\n\r\nThe only slight problem with V3 is that in case where the tree branches in multiple directions (a good example is [getWithdrawableAmount.tree](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/01dd01087ca2702d29c7956cf31128a233931b42/test/unit/sablier-v2-linear/get-withdrawable-amount/getWithdrawableAmount.tree)), the contract names sort of have to be written using the V1 methodology, lest we get duplicates. But this shouldn't be a problem because usually the branching in one direction stops earlier than the bottom-most branch.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### OS Error 63\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"os-error-63\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8782666/175808452-d50beae3-86a3-4583-b838-d58c735d0f27.png\">","createdAt":"2022-06-26T09:48:45Z","labels":[],"number":91,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Testing branching rationale","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-06-30T10:41:43Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/91"},{"author":"andreivladbrg","body":"In this PR https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/pull/271 I suggested to rename the [ISablierV2](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/prb/lockup/src/interfaces/ISablierV2.sol) interface to `ISablierV2Administrative` with the idea that in the future we will have multiple products (LockUp, Payroll) and would be better to create then a common interface, `ISablierV2`, for both of them.\r\n\r\nThe options I suggest are: \r\n- `ISablierV2Administrative`\r\n- `ISablierV2AdminActions`\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, do you have better ideas?","createdAt":"2023-01-23T14:04:58Z","labels":[],"number":286,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Rename the `ISablierV2` interface","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-06-30T10:38:57Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/286"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Transferring a stream NFT is a potentially dangerous operation because the user may be unaware that doing so means forsaking all the streamed funds that have not been withdrawn.

The transfer method can only be accessed by msg.sender which is in this situation the old admin. No need to use that extra contextual variable.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/d7f46c1212ebf9e56b93dfa1acec910b0193e0e9/src/abstracts/SablierV2Adminable.sol#L34-L42\r\n\r\n### SablierV2Lockup \r\n\r\n**→ nftDescriptor**\r\n\r\nThe logic of having a separate contract for the descriptor was (aside from separation of concerns and freezing purposes) to be able to fix visual bugs or update it later. I see that we're storing the descriptor address in an immutable value with no possibility of updating it later on. I suggest we implement a setter for this value.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/d7f46c1212ebf9e56b93dfa1acec910b0193e0e9/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L27\r\n\r\n**→ withdrawMultiple**\r\n\r\nThe permission schema for \"who can withdraw\" (from an item) is (a) a recipient, (b) an authorized person or (c) the sender, as long as the withdraw is directed to the current recipient. (C) is very smart as it allows the sender to pay for the transaction, thus relieving the recipient from that cost.\r\n\r\nThe \"multiple\" version unfortunately limits this ability to just the recipient.

One way is to add an `edit` function that literally updates the properties of an going stream struct.

Hard code versions and let people migrate between.\r\n\r\nI think that this is a known pattern in the industry but I can't recall off the top of my head how it's called. Anyway, the idea is the following:\r\n\r\n1. We build the protocol in such a way that it has a \"migrate\" function that basically transfers a stream from the `_streams` mapping to another v2.x Sablier contract. The transfer would basically delete the stream in the `v2.n` contract and re-create the stream in the `v2.(n+1)` contract, all while not making any claim of funds for either the sender or the recipient.\r\n2. We add a state variable `nextSablierV2Linear` of type `address` that is initially set to zero but which can be subsequently modified by governance. This is the future address of the v2.x Sablier contract.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\nI personally find this model great, because:\r\n\r\n1. It gives us flexibility to keep developing v2.x in a proper, logical way.\r\n2. It doesn't make us custodians in any way whatsoever.\r\n3. It doesn't coerce users into accepting an upgrade of the contract. It's up to them to decide if they want to migrate.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n1.

Below I have suggested a few potential solutions, ordered by desirability and implementation difficulty.\r\n\r\n### 1. Move `createWithDurations` in the periphery\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to keep the `createWithDurations` function in the core contracts - all this function does is to compute the parameters for the `createWithRange` function dynamically using the `block.timestamp` at the time of including the transaction in the block.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the `createMultiple` function(s) that we plan on implementing in the periphery, we could move this function over there.\r\n\r\n### 2. Move the `getStreamed` helpers in an external library\r\n\r\nAs suggested by @andreivladbrg in this [comment](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/pull/220#pullrequestreview-1232365340), we could move the `getStreamed` helpers in a separate library:\r\n\r\n- `getStreamedAmountForMultipleSegments`\r\n- `getStreamedAmountForOneSegment`\r\n\r\nAs I said in that other conversation, one other reason I like this idea is that it makes it possible to perform the pro calculations from outside of the pro contracts - which might be helpful for integrators, or in our periphery contracts.\r\n\r\n### 3. ERC-721 Implementation with Custom Errors\r\n\r\nThis would reduce the bytecode significantly, but unfortunately there is no good, off-the-shelf implementation of ERC-721 that uses custom errors. [I have asked about this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1614347562508500994), and I got no answer.\r\n\r\nOpenZeppelin has opened [EIP-6093](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6093), which purports to retroactively add custom errors to the popular token standards ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. However, the EIP is still in draft, and they are still working on implementing it in their own contracts library.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only workaround in the short term would be to implement this ourselves in [prb-contracts](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-contracts/issues/28).\r\n\r\n### 4. Move the getters to the periphery\r\n\r\nThe idea is to move all the static `get` functions (that is, all except the calculation functions) to the periphery.\r\n\r\nThe counter-argument to this is that it would deteriorate the developer experience for integrators, and really anyone else who'd like to query the data from the core contracts directly, e.g. Etherscan users.\r\n\r\n### 5. Remove flash loan support\r\n\r\nSee the discussion I opened here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/discussions/278\r\n\r\n### ~~6. Merge the `getRecipient` function with `ownerOf`~~\r\n\r\n~~We have a function `getRecipient` that does the same thing as the ERC-721's [`ownerOf`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) function.~~\r\n\r\n~~We provide the former function to provide context to our users (so we have an on-chain reference to who is the \"recipient of the stream\"). But we might have to jettison this function to reduce the size of the pro contract .. after all, the vast majority of Sablier users will use a UI to access the protocol. The UI can make the translation for the user, and refer to the NFT owner as the recipient.~~\r\n\r\n**Update**: the bytecode saving for doing this would be a paltry ~0.05kB. See my [comment](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/discussions/279#discussioncomment-4759616) below.\r\n\r\n### 7. Delete the `renounceAdmin` function\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't save much gas, but the [`renounceAdmin`](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-contracts/blob/1b1693930274cf9806832bbd376412b7ccbe1769/src/access/Adminable.sol#L44) of the `Adminable` contract is technically redundant. We could refactor the `Adminable` contract that has no `renounceAdmin` but which contains only a `transferAdmin` function that accepts a zero address as an argument.\r\n\r\n**Update**: actually, we should definitely do, see #289.\r\n\r\n### 8. Tune down the optimizer\r\n\r\nIt just dawned on me that the *simplest* way to lower the contract size is to lower the number of optimizer runs. This is explained in detail in the [Downsizing contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/downsizing-contracts-to-fight-the-contract-size-limit/) guide on the Ethereum website, and also in the Solidity docs on the [optimizer](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/optimizer.html).\r\n\r\nJust by changing the number of optimizer runs to 5,000, I have managed to get the size of the pro contract down to ~24.472kB.\r\n\r\nThe only caveat to this solution is that it goes against what we want - we would ideally set the optimizer runs to 2^32-1, just like [Seaport does](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/049828e49da5e142a1a9f6cc0a725069e61e2564/foundry.toml#L14), since we expect the Sablier V2 contracts to be called lots and lots of time during their lifetimes (they are singleton contracts, after all - storage and functionality and bundled together).\r\n\r\nSee related discussion in #290.","createdAt":"2023-01-19T12:15:54Z","labels":[],"number":279,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Strategies for lowering the size of the `SablierV2LockupPro` contract","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T11:18:28Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/279"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"During one of our latest meetings in person, we have agreed that it would be clearer to rename the `SablierV2Linear` and the `SablierV2Pro` contracts differently to signal the fact that these contracts enabled closed-ended streaming with capital lockups.\r\n\r\nWe haven't, however, agreed upon a final new prefix. These are the idea we had:\r\n\r\n- `Lockup`\r\n- `CapitalLockup`\r\n- `ClosedEnded`\r\n- `ClosedEndedLockup`\r\n- `CE` (as in, \"Closed Ended\")\r\n- `Closed`\r\n- `Vesting` (though I know @razgraf doesn't like to reference any particular use case in the contract name)\r\n\r\nThe `Linear` and the `Pro` suffixes could be optionally shortened to `L` and `P`, respectively.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the variant I like the most is `Lockup` because it captures the current logic of creating streams quite accurately. \"Lockup\" as a term [is used in traditional finance in vesting contexts](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/lock-up-vesting), as well as in crypto (see [Near's post](https://wiki.near.org/getting-started/near-token/lockups)).\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the issue with `ClosedEnded` is that it doesn't indicate to users that they have to make a one-time deposit in order for the stream to start. In principle, a stream could be closed-ended while being lockup-free, allowing users to top up.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, an open-ended stream must necessarily be lockup-free, because a payment rate per second cannot be calculated from a fixed deposit without a stop time. From this perspective, `ClosedEnded` would be a better prefix, because it would mirror the `OpenEnded` prefix we would presumably use for what we currently call [`SablierV2Payroll`](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/).\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I tend to favor `Lockup`, but if we agree that we will never build a closed-ended contract that is lockup-free and has top ups, then `ClosedEnded` would also be a good fit.","createdAt":"2022-12-31T17:46:25Z","labels":[],"number":232,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Ideas for how to rename the contracts","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T11:18:41Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/232"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"Related to PR #31 we should start tracking (probably using data from foundry) gas consumption for our heavy read-only methods.\r\n\r\nIn case we decide to have a light version of the app that only relies on web3 calls, we'll make use of multicalls to batch queries to the RPC.

Imagine that you hear about Sablier and you are interested to set up streams for your team and your investors.\r\n\r\nNow, someone tells you that the Sablier V2 contract admin has the ability to turn on flash loans for any token being streamed via the Sablier V2 protocol.\r\n\r\nHow would you react to this?\r\n\r\nThe rational answer should be that you don't care - your governance system is presumably flash-loan resistant, lest the system is guaranteed to break in the future, e.g. when creating a lending market on Aave for your token.\r\n\r\nHowever, people can sometimes be irrational, and their knee-jerk reaction might be to eschew using Sablier just because of the *possibility* of flash loans being turned on. One doesn't have to assume that the contract admin is malicious - assuming that the admin key can be compromised suffices in this context.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I wish to re-consider the flash loanability idea and/ or implementation. As much as I am on board with the revenue-generating benefits of flash loans, I wonder if this will not end up losing us users, and thus earning less broker and protocol fees in the long-term.\r\n\r\nOne potential workaround is to limit the flash loans to a stablecoin allowlist - we would hard-code the addresses of USDC, DAI, etc., in the contract constructor. This is not obviously not great, since it would add additional complexity in contracts that are otherwise already complex, and it would also limit the protocol to a few asset addresses that might change in the future, but the idea makes sense.\r\n\r\nI would be very curious to hear your thoughts on this concern - @razgraf, @maxdesalle, and @andreivladbrg.","createdAt":"2023-01-19T11:26:33Z","labels":[],"number":278,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Flash loans as a potential deterrent for vesting users","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T11:18:54Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/278"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"As discussed in #204, I find the `grossDepositAmount` param name rather verbose.

However, if the caller is an allow-listed router, then the fee is split with the router (e.g. we get to keep 20%). The router would be a middleware smart contract that would create the stream on behalf of the end user, and it would be the responsibility of the TPFED to build it (we could recommend them to use something like [PRBProxy][prb-proxy]).\r\n\r\nLimitations with this approach are:\r\n\r\n- The % that we get to split with all TPFEDs is fixed. We cannot split preferentially based on how much TVL the TPFED brings to Sablier. It's quite important to be able to charge preferentially because as the TPFED grows, they will increasingly have an incentive to move away from Sablier\r\n- We cannot at the same time not charge a fee on our UI and let TPFED charge fees.

But does that assumption hold water?\r\n\r\nLet's explore the user flow in three cases. I shall assume that Alice wishes to create one $USDC stream toward Bob. What I refer to by \"periphery contract\" is either a bespoke implementation or an instance of PRBProxy (the logic is the same).\r\n\r\n## 1. Authorization\r\n\r\n1. Alice authorizes the periphery contract Foo to create Sablier streams on her behalf.\r\n2. Alice approves the Sablier contract to spend her $USDC balance (this step is still necessary because the ERC-20 contract knows nothing about the Sablier authorization flow).\r\n3. Alice calls a function on Foo to create the stream, and Foo creates it on her behalf.\r\n\r\n## 2. Standard Transfer From\r\n\r\n1. Alice authorizes the periphery contract to spend her $USDC balance.\r\n2. Alice calls a function on Foo to create the stream, Foo transfers the tokens from her to it, and then creates the stream on her behalf by setting the `sender` argument to be Alice's address.\r\n\r\n## 3. EIP-2612 Permit\r\n\r\nThis only works with ERC-20 tokens compatible with [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612). \r\n\r\n1. Alice signs a transaction data blob off-chain. Notably, this step is *not* a transaction (unlike all others).\r\n2. Alice calls a function on Foo to create the stream *with a signature* ([see this](https://github.com/hifi-finance/hifi/blob/cf10f3be1dfaacd5b703cedd8898dd511da06a54/packages/proxy-target/contracts/HifiProxyTarget.sol#L535-L545) as an example for how I implemented permit signatures at Hifi). Foo then creates the stream on her behalf by setting the `sender` argument to be Alice's address.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the authorization system is the worst UX of all, because there are 3 separate transactions needed for creating the stream. EIP-2612 permit is the best, but few ERC-20 tokens support it, and the frontend implementation is non-trivial.\r\n\r\nThe only case that I can think of when the 1st method would be useful is when a DeFi protocol integrates Sablier V2 and, for some reason or another, they would also like their users to create the Sablier streams on their UI. But still, I don't see why they wouldn't go with the 2nd method described above.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would suggest sticking with the standard `transferFrom` flow and completely remove the authorization system from our contracts. It adds undue complexity, which costs time and money (remember we want to audit this). We can still keep a copy of the current logic on an archive branch, for historical purposes.","createdAt":"2022-06-19T10:18:39Z","labels":[],"number":74,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"The authorization system is not needed anymore","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T11:25:59Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/74"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"In an offline discussion, @razgraf made the suggestion to implement a \"withdraw on behalf of\" functionality, which would enable  third-party relayers to pay the gas costs for withdrawing for end-users.\r\n\r\nMy only reservation is that it would take quite some time to implement this, and we already have a long list of more urgent matters to tackle.

Higher gas cost for cliff-less users (`create` costs ~11k more, `withdraw` costs ~2k more)\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nAll in all, I think that merging the two contracts would be worth it. The slightly higher gas cost should be fine. The gas cost is also influenced by the underlying ERC-20 token used for streaming, so whatever small optimization we do here might not matter as much as we'd think it does.","createdAt":"2022-06-13T16:13:11Z","labels":[],"number":47,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Should we merge the SablierV2Linear and SablierV2Cliff contracts?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T11:26:58Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/47"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"In #131, @andreivladbrg made all of our contract inherit from the ERC-721 standard. The most crucial implication of that is that now there is no `recipient` field in the `Stream` struct anymore - the [`ownerOf`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification) function of the ERC-721 is what gives the recipient of the stream now.\r\n\r\nWe have a terminology problem. We can keep referring to the recipient of the stream as the \"recipient\" in the code, too, by choosing to keep the `getRecipient` getters and by naming our in-memory variables as such.\r\n\r\nHowever, that incurs a little bit of additional gas (though I am not sure if it's only deployment cost that get affected or there's also a runtime overhead).\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be more gas efficient to use the `ownerOf` function directly and remove all `recipient` references. But that would create some confusion because the sender of the stream could easily be confused with the ERC-721 owner.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards keeping the `recipient`, since the gas overhead is small while the clarity benefits are large.

I [integrated](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/compare/feat/solana-app?expand=1) it into our interfaces repo and successfully [reused](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/blob/4a4620ab743e39d264868c007643cee7481b1e53/apps/solsab/src/components/header/header.tsx#L5) styled-components from our components library. However, this approach has surfaced several challenges.\r\n\r\n## Problems\r\n\r\n### **1. Rendering Issues**\r\n\r\n- The styled-components library isn’t fully compatible with React Server Components (RSC), introduced in the Next.js App Router. Since it relies on React Context—which RSC disallows—it must fall back on a global context.\r\n- Every component that uses styled-components must include the `'use client'` directive, forcing client-side rendering even when server-side rendering would be beneficial.\r\n- A `StyledComponentsRegistry` [workaround](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components) is required, adding complexity.\r\n\r\n### **2. Compatibility Concerns**\r\n\r\n- Next.js now recommends `styled-components@6` for integration, but our repo currently uses v5. This discrepancy may or may not lead to unpredictable issues over time.\r\n- Styled-components v5 works with Next.js 14 and React 18 but breaks in Next.js 15 and React 19 workaround part, likely due to type mismatches in React 19.\r\n\r\n### **3. Migration Challenges**\r\n\r\n- The primary blocker for now is styled-components. A potential long-term solution would be transitioning to Tailwind CSS (or another modern industry-standard solution) that is fully compatible with the Next.js App Router.\r\n\r\n## **Potential Solutions**\r\n\r\n### **1. Maintain the Current Setup**\r\n\r\n- Continue using Next.js 14 pages with styled-components as-is.\r\n- This approach ensures stability and allows us to ship the product faster.\r\n- Later, we can adopt Tailwind CSS (or another solution) through a gradual migration.\r\n\r\n### **2. Use the App Router**\r\n\r\n- Utilize the Next.js App Router with a styled-components [workaround](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components) while progressively refactoring components to Tailwind CSS (or an alternative).\r\n- This approach enables new features to leverage the App Router while phasing out styled-components, enhancing [performance](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#benefits-of-server-rendering), SEO, and reducing technical debt. It may also help resolve old rendering [issues](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1188#discussion-7481689).\r\n- Because of the many shared dependencies in the current interfaces repo, the new setup is more unstable and may cause delays.\r\n\r\n## **Feedback**\r\n\r\nI'm leaning a bit more toward the second option since reducing technical debt can pay off in the long run. However, if fast product shipping is the priority, I think the first option might be better.

Metamorphic Mindset\r\n\r\nWe should aim to write highly metamorphic software—easy to refactor, not just to run.\r\n\r\nHow quickly we can refactor and add new features is infinitely more important than whether the code has a particular\r\nfeature at any given time (or whether we have ticked an item off our TODO list).\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means:\r\n\r\n**Ruthlessly de-duplicating code and minimizing repetitions.

While working on the integration, I got stuck several times, which led me to discover many opportunities for improvement. I've prepared a detailed report with my findings here: [Metamorphic Findings](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1725) report, but here are the key areas I'd like us to consider:\r\n\r\n1. Code repetition → by far, the biggest one.\r\n2. Deep nesting patterns.\r\n3. Explanatory comments.\r\n4. More robust error management.\r\n\r\n### Chubby Kid Analogy\r\n\r\nTo help illustrate where we are, imagine our codebase as a teenager who's been growing fast and developing some habits that aren't serving him well. He's been consuming too much sugar (repeated code patterns), which is starting to affect his energy and agility. The complexity is making it harder for him to move quickly and adapt to new situations. He has become a chubby kid.\r\n\r\nWhen he tries to make changes or tackle new challenges, he finds himself getting winded more easily than he'd like.\r\nSmall adjustments in one area often require compensating changes in 2-3 other places. Even their development environment\r\nruns hot under the workload (Next.js in dev mode really heats up my M4 Max).\r\n\r\nThe good news? This is totally fixable.\r\n\r\n## Solutioning and Planning Ahead\r\n\r\nWith the Solana launch approaching, we have two options for implementing the Metamorphic Refactor (MR):\r\n\r\n1. Tackle the MR before Solana (my recommendation).\r\n2. Address the MR after Solana.\r\n\r\n### Why I'd Suggest Going First\r\n\r\nHere's my thinking:\r\n\r\n1. I believe the MR is the single, most impactful investment we can make in our codebase right now (i.e. `priority: 0`). It's the foundation that will make every future feature — including Solana — easier to build and maintain.\r\n2. Addressing these patterns now will actually make us faster in the long run. If we wait until after Solana, we'll be working with more complex interdependencies, which may slow down our Q4 roadmap.\r\n\r\nI'm confident we can still hit our August 31st launch target with this approach:\r\n\r\n- During and after EthCC, I'll focus entirely on preparing the MR.\r\n- I'll get the PR ready for your review.\r\n- Once we're aligned, you can focus on implementing it.\r\n- Then you can rebuild the Solana work on the new foundation (manually, not via rebase).\r\n\r\n### Your Decision\r\n\r\nThat said, this is ultimately your call. I respect whatever direction you choose, and I'm committed to making either\r\npath work.\r\n\r\nI would like to get [PR 1712](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/pull/1712_) merged soon, and it would be helpful if we could start incorporating some of these patterns in the Solana branch going forward.\r\n\r\nAll I ask is to get hasty and avoid a long-winded debate. If you have not been persuaded after reading this discussion and the associated report, that's fine.\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss this over Zoom or in person in Cannes—whatever works best for you.\r\n\r\n## Nota Bene\r\n\r\nBuilding safe and scalable software is hard work. Very hard. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished with the Sablier UI so far.\r\n\r\nI also believe the issues reported are serious, and I see this as an opportunity for improvement—both on the technical\r\nside and in our team cohesion and productivity.\r\n","createdAt":"2025-06-26T21:20:29Z","labels":[],"number":1726,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Metamorphic Refactor","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-07-16T08:21:46Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1726"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"I don't see any reason for using `distinct_on` in the Envio queries.

However, this is a feature, not a bug. The names may contain sensitive information, and so the senders may not want all recipients to see that a particular stream is associated with a particular entity.\r\n\r\nP.S. this local storage implementation was also suggested to us by our fellow cohort participants at CSX.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives Considered\r\n\r\n- **Onchain names**. Adding a `name` parameter in the create functions has security implications. See https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/pull/945.\r\n- **Web2 API storage**. As explained by Mircea, this would involve a significant refactor of the API, the UI, and the database.

The app should react to a user changing their connected wallet and assume the new identity automatically.\r\n\r\nIt turns out Solana wallets do not implement this standard or, for those that do, it's broken.\r\n\r\n### The research\r\n\r\n#### General\r\n\r\nStarting out from [this comment](https://solana.stackexchange.com/a/309/40290) from '22 it's clear that there's no standard being implemented for emitting account-changed events.\r\n\r\nSince Phantom (followed by Backpack or Solflare) are the main wallets by usage on Solana, I figured we focused on one at a time, to at least fix the UX for some big part of our future users. Phantom should do for the first sprint.\r\n\r\n#### Phantom\r\n\r\nPhantom's official docs state they offer support for [detecting](https://docs.phantom.com/solana/detecting-the-provider) the connected wallet and, our goal, listening for [account changes](https://docs.phantom.com/solana/establishing-a-connection#changing-accounts).\r\n<img width=\"809\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-05-20 at 14 29 09\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73a4c6da-a92a-456d-adcf-dd85b7aecf48\" />\r\n\r\nWe can also confirm this implementation being available through our wallet wrapper SDK (@solana/wallet-adapter-base) inside the [Phantom adapter](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/blob/master/packages/wallets/phantom/src/adapter.ts) - see [`accountChanged`](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/blob/cf1d21701904d40eeb061ae180d8878a93434c26/packages/wallets/phantom/src/adapter.ts#L161).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nwallet.on('accountChanged', this._accountChanged);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while testing it out, the app couldn't catch any `accountChanged` events being emitted. The adapter did emit events for `connect` whenever there was a complete flow (user is not connected, clicks to connect - not working on auto-connect) but no changes were recorded afterwards.\r\n\r\nUpon further research we can see some more instances of this issue being flagged:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/issues/883\r\n- https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/issues/1008\r\n- https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/issues/1069\r\n\r\n> Try building your app and running in production mode. It worked for me.\r\n\r\nSome mention building the app as a fix, although this hasn't [worked](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/issues/883#issuecomment-2532872504) for others - I've also tested it and it doesn't work on my end either.\r\n\r\n#### Network changes\r\n\r\nThis problem extends to network/chain changes between devnet and mainnet, where I don't believe we'd even have events being emitted (even if they don't work).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWhile this issue is (hopefully) being handled wallet-side, I propose we add an informational note / warning in the **Account Modal** about wallet switching in Solana (and possibly a \"refresh\" button a.k.a. log-out and reload page). The flow our user has to follow will be:\r\n\r\n- Switch to the other account from the wallet\r\n- Log out\r\n- Refresh page\r\n- Log back in\r\n\r\nIf the other account is already \"approved\" to connect to the app, users can simply change account and refresh the app. But the explainer should cover the full use-case.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLater edit: streamflow has this working ... need to check exactly how\r\n","createdAt":"2025-05-20T11:43:30Z","labels":["topic: solana"],"number":1638,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Wallet switching in Solana","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-05-26T08:37:53Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1638"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) is a tool I've noticed while playing with the [wagmi](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi) codebase.

This helps address some common performance bottlenecks:\r\n>\r\n>    It reduces the amount of work (and time) required to render the initial view and to process updates.\r\n>    It reduces the memory footprint by avoiding over-allocation of DOM nodes.\r\n\r\n### How do we bind this system to our page scroll?\r\n\r\nFor things like the Token List, we can pre-define the scroll-surface to a set height.\r\n\r\nFor places where the scroll surface is .. the page itself (think X/Facebook's timeline page) we need to bind the scroll (of the virtualized list) to the top-level scroll container. Based on this comment [here](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/issues/192#issuecomment-654269017) we've forked the functionality of Frederico's [react-window-scroller](https://github.com/FedericoDiRosa/react-window-scroller) and used it to implement our Dashboard stream table - and the [<Virtualized.Scroller/> ](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/blob/41af77001d4afe7e9b6edc0feb7975c4fa4f3c61/packages/components/src/molecules/Virtualized/Scroller/index.tsx)system.\r\n\r\n## Important notes\r\n\r\n### Hierarchy in the DOM and top-margin spacing\r\n\r\nThe scroll re-positioning relies on a container's `offsetTop`, a value influenced by the `offsetParent`. This parent, as per the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetParent) docs is **not the nearest DOM parent** as one would think.\r\n\r\n>  The HTMLElement.offsetParent read-only property returns a reference to the element which is the closest (nearest in the containment hierarchy) positioned ancestor element.\r\n>\r\n> A positioned ancestor is either:\r\n>   - an element with a non-static position, or\r\n>   - td, th, table in case the element itself is static positioned.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in our current Table system, this usually is the first **relative** parent, closest to the Table's body. In the case of the main dashboard, the `offsetParent` of our table of streams is the Page itself. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1302\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-29 at 15 49 57\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/15740806/e651868f-0c02-4c86-a170-56ea737424ab\">\r\n\r\n### Misbehaving tables and the fix\r\n\r\nThe above is quite important as an implementation where an element *closer to the table* but *further away from the top-page elements* is marked as the `offsetParent` will cause the scroller offset to start removing items from the DOM much earlier than needed. \r\n\r\nIn the example below, we can see a wrapper intentionally positioned `relative` will cause this visual bug.\r\n\r\n| App | DOM |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| <img width=\"852\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-29 at 15 52 03\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/15740806/769f1ecf-38a1-4608-8db5-22eddf3360fa\"> | <img width=\"1417\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-29 at 15 54 58\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/15740806/3562d75e-4e9d-44a9-b10f-e1a297019eab\"> |\r\n\r\nIf we make sure the path is clear and the `offsetParent` is yet again our top level component (the page div), things go back to normal.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1704\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-29 at 15 57 21\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/15740806/245bae90-c15c-4f24-b3b7-87a39a05e2c6\">\r\n","createdAt":"2023-10-29T16:08:47Z","labels":[],"number":612,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"[Walkthrough] React window scroller and virtualized lists","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T11:02:23Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/612"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"> [!NOTE]\r\n> The lists herein refer to high-level features that are noticeable by end users.

Thus solves the \"payment starts on the 1st of the month\" problem.\r\n\r\nIs there any way we can include similar logic for scheduled salary updates?\r\n\r\n## The \"Settle and Update\" bundle\r\n\r\nIn case of salaries changing, the sender has to do some wild tricks to calculate remaining balances. I'm thinking of adding a bespoke action to help in this particular case. A **rate change** on steroids. The UX goes like this:\r\n\r\n### Short flow\r\nSender picks stream, chooses date for the \"rate change\". Old stream ends, new stream starts.\r\n\r\n### Long flow (explainer)\r\n- [Prerequisites] [`startTime`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/issues/351) and [`transferFrom`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/issues/361) implemented in the protocol\r\n- Sender picks a Flow<sub>1</sub> stream they want to update\r\n- Sender picks when the Flow<sub>1</sub> stream ends (say last day of the month)\r\n- We calculate how much they'd need to pay the recipient up to that date, based on the RPS<sub>1</sub>\r\n- We bundle (through `batch`)\r\n   1. a rage-quit: sender `voids`, `refunds` from Flow<sub>1</sub> \r\n   2. a transfer: `Flow.transferFrom` to send the owed balance (remaining from Flow<sub>1</sub>) to the recipient address\r\n   3. a create flow stream: sender creates Flow<sub>2</sub> with the new RPS<sub>1</sub>, starting early next month\r\n   4. optional top-up/initial deposit step for Flow<sub>2</sub> \r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nAn improvement to this proposal would be scheduled flow restarts (the restart function itself supporting a `startTime`). Realistically we're not going to probably be building a Gelato integration any time soon, so supporting this at the protocol level means the user can keep the same stream throughout the update. But, I realize this might be overkill or could make the logic too complex, which is why I'm proposing an approach we can deliver with the features already planned.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @sablier-labs/engineers?\r\n","createdAt":"2025-02-10T13:23:59Z","labels":[],"number":1415,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Flow use-case for \"new salaries\"","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T10:44:35Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1415"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"I have this in my to-do list since forever but in our future optimization sprint for the apps, we should audit performance using https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan. \r\n\r\nIt's an amazing dev tool for catching messy re-rendering.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidenybai/react-scan/refs/heads/main/.github/assets/demo.gif)","createdAt":"2025-02-24T11:36:45Z","labels":[],"number":1450,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Audit the apps using react-scan","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T09:16:21Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1450"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"Prior to #1539 we used `NEXT_PUBLIC_SABLIER_ENV` to store the current environment the app was running in.

[`VERCEL_ENV`](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables/system-environment-variables#VERCEL_ENV) is supposed to only have 3 values\r\n\r\nWhile the docs mark that variable as only being able to have 3 values (production, development or preview), [logging it at build time](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/actions/runs/14063350810/job/39379629436) shows that it actually has custom values too.\r\n\r\n2. [`VERCEL_TARGET_ENV`](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables/system-environment-variables#VERCEL_TARGET_ENV) works, but not always \r\n\r\nThe docs instruct on using the `target` flavor of this environment variable. This advice isn't bad, but upon trying it we realized another problem: these variables are not available during runtime\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2025-03-25 at 17 48 51 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4552f39e-4554-482d-855a-9898dccc4d35)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, logging them will result in `undefined` values regardless of prefix (`np` is the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` version of each) or name.\r\n\r\nFor now, we've decided to fall back to using `NEXT_PUBLIC_SABLIER_ENV` since that one we can control much easier.\r\n\r\nThe question remains though: why isn't `VERCEL_ENV` working as intended?\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2025-03-25T16:12:59Z","labels":[],"number":1548,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Why isn't `VERCEL_ENV` working?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T09:15:25Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1548"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"I just stumbled upon this tool [`tsup`](https://github.com/egoist/tsup), which uses [`esbuild`](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) under the hood, which claims to be 10-100x faster than baseline:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild/raw/main/images/benchmark-light.svg\r\n\r\n<img width=\"870\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 2 02 11 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/8782666/e6a4a1ef-46d5-480b-936d-a978166410ea\">\r\n","createdAt":"2023-06-06T12:02:31Z","labels":[],"number":327,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Explore `tsup` for speeding up build performance","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-09T19:50:38Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/327"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Feature request tracker for GitHub OAuth in the airdrop custom claim page.\n\ncc @sablier-labs/business","createdAt":"2025-04-07T18:40:28Z","labels":[],"number":1569,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Connect GitHub in custom claim page","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-09T18:09:27Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1569"},{"author":"IaroslavMazur","body":"Similar to Aave's \"Withdraw & Switch\" feature, we could, also, enhance the UX of our users - and tap into the liquidity we're processing, at the same time.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44cabaa5-6e07-448c-bc93-ce27b9d2c259\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44cabaa5-6e07-448c-bc93-ce27b9d2c259\" width=\"100\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n---\r\n### The idea\r\n\r\nOffer the Stream Recipients to (optionally) automatically swap their streamed tokens for some other tokens when withdrawing the former from the Stream.

Maybe if we set a value for the gas parameter that is above the block gas limit, `simulateAndRevert` would return a value that is greater than the block gas limit. TBD.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> As explained in the Infura docs for [`eth_call`](https://docs.metamask.io/services/reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/eth_call/), the value of the gas parameter must be at most 10x the actual block gas limit of the chain. E.g. Sepolia has 36M now, so the hard-coded gas must be 360M at most.\r\n\r\n### Divisions\r\n\r\nIf we manage to obtain the estimation from `simulateAndRevert`, we can then divide it by the actual block gas limit of the chain. Let's call the result of this division the `ratio`. Then, we can divide the total number of streams in the user's CSV by the `ratio`, and obtain a pretty good approximation for what the real max batch size on that chain is.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> As explained [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1473#issuecomment-2729864694) and [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1473#issuecomment-2724872512), this solution would work only for **Constant** shapes, i.e. vesting shapes that have a constant gas consumption per stream. An example of a **Non-Constant** shape is Monthly Unlocks (streams in the same batch can have different numbers of months).\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively low-priority task, so we can consider it for Q4.

This is because [we don't have a reverse mapping between user addresses and streams IDs](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/644).\r\n\r\nIt may be possible that by indexing events, we would be able to provide some sort of dashboard-like experience, but more research is required to confirm (i) if this is possible and (ii) if it is, what sort of UX we could offer (e.g. would users need to wait 10 minutes for their streams to appear?).\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the app will be simplistic:\r\n\r\n1. Create LL stream\r\n2. Cancel stream\r\n3. View basic stream profile\r\n4. Withdraw from stream\r\n\r\nAny non-create feature will require the user to know their stream ID in advance.\r\n\r\n### Starting Point\r\n\r\nAs noted by @razgraf, we already have a starting point with [v2-sandbox](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-sandbox), although that repository should remain separate from the lite app because it contains sample code snippets and subgraph guides.

Generate a Merkle Tree from the client-provided file.\r\n2. Serialize the campaign and store it on IPFS.\r\n3. Precompute and save the eligibility proofs for each qualifying address.\r\n4. Provide an eligibility endpoint for client applications and web pages to access.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, we decided to divide the functionality into two components:\r\n\r\n1. A [Rust-based script](https://github.com/sablier-labs/rust-merkle-processor): Responsible for generating the Merkle Tree and handling the serialization process.\r\n2. A [NestJS API](https://github.com/sablier-labs/custom-airdrops-template): Precomputes all proofs, stores them in a Redis instance, and provides the eligibility endpoint.\r\n\r\n**Why Redis as the Database?**\r\n\r\nWe chose Redis for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. High-speed read operations.\r\n2. No write/update operations after the initial data population.\r\n3. Recipient addresses can serve as keys.\r\n4. No need for complex queries (e.g., joins).\r\n5. A well-defined value format is guaranteed.\r\n\r\n**Note:** While reviewing the code, you will notice that, in addition to the JSON format uploaded to IPFS, we also use Protocol Buffers (protobuf). This choice was made because protobuf is more efficient for handling large-scale campaigns.\r\n\r\n### Rust script\r\n\r\nYou can find the source code for the Rust script [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/rust-merkle-processor).\r\n\r\nWhile developing this script, we aimed to reuse as much of the Merkle API structure and data types as possible.\r\n\r\nThe script supports two execution modes:\r\n\r\n2. `file` mode: Uses a `.csv` file as the data source.\r\n1. `ipfs` mode: Uses an IPFS CID as the data source.\r\nTo switch between these modes, set the `EXECUTION_MODE` environment variable to the desired value.\r\n\r\n**Running the Script in file Mode**\r\n\r\nIf you choose to run the script in file mode, ensure that:\r\n\r\n1. A `data.csv` file (containing recipients and amounts for the campaign) is placed at the root of the project.\r\n2. You update the `DECIMALS` constant in src/main.rs to match the token’s decimal precision.\r\n\r\nBy running `cargo run` command the script will process the file, upload it to IPFS, print the CID in the console and generate a `campaign.bin` file.\r\n\r\n**Running the Script in ipfs Mode**\r\n\r\nIf you choose to run the script in file mode you need to ensure that the `CAMPAIGN_CID` env var has the proper value. By running `cargo run` command the script will process the data from ipfs and generate a `campaign.bin` file.\r\n\r\n**Note:** For both the execution mode ensure that the IPFS related information are configured properly.\r\n\r\n### Nest JS API\r\n\r\nYou can find the source code for the NestJS API [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/custom-airdrops-template).\r\n\r\nThis API follows a module-oriented architecture typical of NestJS applications and has two main responsibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Exposing an eligibility endpoint for interfaces to query.\r\n2. Precomputing Proofs & Populating Redis\r\n\r\n**Precomputing all recipients' Merkle proofs and storing them in a Redis instance.**\r\n\r\nBefore starting this process, ensure the following:\r\n\r\n- The campaign.bin file (generated by the Rust script) is placed inside the src/files directory.\r\n- The `REDIS_URL` environment variable points to a valid Redis instance.\r\n- The `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to development. This action is **disabled** on the production environment.\r\n\r\nOnce these conditions are met, you can start the local server by running:\r\n`yarn start:dev`\r\nAfter the server is running, trigger the process by sending a GET request to:\r\n`http://localhost:3000/process`\r\n\r\nThis will initiate the Merkle proof computation and populate the Redis instance accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Check eligibility**\r\n\r\nThis endpoint is available in both the development and the production environments. The `REDIS_URL` should point to the correct Redis Instance. After the server is running (locally or in a deployed environment), trigger the process by sending a GET request to:\r\n`{server_url}/eligibility?address={0x...}`\r\n\r\n### Modifying the Protobuf Structure & Corresponding Types\r\n\r\nWhile extending the application, follow the standard practices of the respective frameworks and programming languages (NestJS/Rust). However, if you need to modify the protobuf structure and its corresponding types, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n**Rust**\r\n\r\n1. Open src/campaign.proto and update the file with the desired structure.\r\n2. Run `cargo build`. This will regenerate the data types in `src/generated` based on the updated protobuf schema.\r\n\r\n**Nest JS** \r\n\r\n1. Open `src/proto/campaign.proto` and update the file with the desired structure.\r\n2. Run the following commands to regenerate the protobuf files:\r\n`npx pbjs --target static-module --wrap commonjs -o src/proto/campaign_pb.js src/proto/campaign.proto\r\nnpx pbts -o src/proto/campaign_pb.d.ts src/proto/campaign_pb.js`\r\nThis will update `src/proto/campaign_pb.js` and `src/proto/campaign_pb.d.ts`, ensuring the correct type definitions for the modified schema.\r\n\r\n### End-to-End Guide for Deploying a Custom Server\r\n\r\nWhen a client requests the deployment of a custom server, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n**1. Login to Railway**\r\n\r\n1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/) and log in with the appropriate credentials.\r\n2.  Select or create a new Railway Workspace \r\n\r\n**2. Redis setup**\r\n\r\n3. Click on \"Create New Project\" and select the option \"Empty Project\"\r\n4. Click the \"Create\" button (top-right corner), then select \"Database\" → \"Add Redis\".\r\n5. Select the newly created instance and select the data tab\r\n6. Select the newly created Redis instance and navigate to the \"Data\" tab\r\n7. Click \"Connect to Database Redis\" → \"Public Network\", then copy the Connection URL\r\n8. Use this connection string to set the `REDIS_URL` environment variable in the NestJS API\r\n\r\n**3. Deploy the NestJS API**\r\n\r\n9. Click \"Create\" (top-right corner), then select \"GitHub repo\".\r\n10. Choose [sablier-labs/custom-airdrops-template](https://github.com/sablier-labs/custom-airdrops-template) or the cloned version of the repository.\r\n11. After the instance is created, go to the \"Settings\" tab and disconnect the branch under the \"Branch connected to production\" section (since GitHub Actions will handle deployment).\r\n\r\n**4. Run the Rust Script**\r\n\r\n12. Depending on the available data, execute the Rust script in the appropriate execution mode **Note** If running in `file` mode, the generated CID should be provided to Sablier Interface to create the actual campaign.\r\n\r\n**5. Run the Rust Script**\r\n\r\n13. Copy the generated `campaign.bin` file from the Rust script and place it inside the `src/files` directory in the NestJS API.\r\n14. Run a local instance of the NestJS API and trigger the process by performing a GET request to: `http://localhost:3000/process`\r\n\r\n**6. Finalize Deployment**\r\n\r\n15. Update the GitHub Actions workflow of the NestJS API to use the Railway instance created in **Step 9**, ensuring that all environment variables are correctly configured.\r\n16. Trigger the deployment and verify that everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Load/Stress Testing the Deployed API\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in load/stress testing the deployed version of the API, I highly recommend using the [K6 library from Grafana](https://k6.io/)—a powerful and efficient tool for performance testing.\r\n\r\nYou can find a GitHub Gist with a stress test script for a deployed version of the [API](https://gist.github.com/gavriliumircea/6b4f47c3608fc0191ebc89ad36846474)\r\n\r\n**Test Results**\r\n\r\nFor a campaign with 1 million users, a test was conducted with 10,000 eligibility requests executed in 1 minute, yielding the following results:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9aa64ad-1ce4-499e-a6f7-69fa633e5ef5)\r\n","createdAt":"2025-02-19T14:08:15Z","labels":[],"number":1444,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Prepare and deploy custom server for airdrops campaigns","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-02-20T09:37:52Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1444"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Source the number of users from Dune rather than having it hard-coded on the landing page:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"397\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 3 24 00 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/8782666/eb5db217-fc86-413b-ae1a-40ca47caa661\">\r\n\r\nThis would make maintainability easier because we wouldn't have to keep updating the figures.\r\n\r\nAlso, I imagine that if we do this, we could also pull other sorts of interesting data from Dune (and display them on the landing page):","createdAt":"2023-10-11T14:25:09Z","labels":[],"number":589,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Source number of users from Dune","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-02-18T16:01:37Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/589"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Low-priority, but we've recently received an (indirect) request from Treehouse for building a UI to approve an operator for the NFT.\r\n\r\nI have started this GD to monitor feature requests for this.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we should suggest users to use [ABI Ninja](https://abi.ninja) for this.\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/engineers\r\n\r\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"SCR-20250217-loth\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e46eb218-0c2f-4292-806d-1e2abc6eb7ee\" />\r\n","createdAt":"2025-02-17T10:57:28Z","labels":[],"number":1430,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"UI for approving an NFT operator","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-02-18T15:54:56Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1430"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"This thread is for integrators we know of who are using our indexers/subgraphs.

Since the launch of Airdrops, we have experienced significant usage, and this discussion will also address the challenges we are encountering and the strategies we are exploring to overcome them.\r\n\r\n### Functionalities overview\r\n\r\nFor the Airdrops processing and proof generation we use 2 separate systems:\r\n\r\n- Some [Rust written lambda functions](https://github.com/sablier-labs/merkle-api) hosted on Vercel.\r\n- [2 Node JS services](https://github.com/sablier-labs/services) hosted on Railway connected to a Postgres DB.\r\n\r\n1. **Airdrop create**: The provided .csv file is uploaded to a Rust Lambda function, which verifies the file, generates a Merkle Tree from the data, uploads the serialized tree to IPFS, and returns the root and IPFS CID if successful. At this stage, the campaign is not yet introduced into the database. Once the MerkleFactory contract emits a CreateLL, CreateLT, or CreateInstant event, it is picked up by the [processor service](https://github.com/sablier-labs/services/tree/staging/apps/processor), which actively listens for these events. When such an event is registered, the corresponding campaign is processed and introduced into the database.\r\n2. **Check eligibility**: This call is made directly to the [API service](https://github.com/sablier-labs/services/tree/staging/apps/api). If the campaign has already been processed, the API either computes or fetches the Merkle Proof from the database, depending on whether the proof was precomputed. Otherwise, the campaign is downloaded from IPFS, and the proof is computed on the fly.\r\n3.  **Eligible**: This call is made directly to the [API service](https://github.com/sablier-labs/services/tree/staging/apps/api). It returns all processed campaigns where the specified address is included in the recipient list.\r\n4. **Hidden**:This call is made directly to the [API service](https://github.com/sablier-labs/services/tree/staging/apps/api). It returns all processed campaigns that were marked as hidden.\r\n5. **Campaign details**:This call is made directly to the [API service](https://github.com/sablier-labs/services/tree/staging/apps/api). It returns all the information available about a specific processed campaign.\r\n6. **Update campaign details**: This call is made directly to the [API service](https://github.com/sablier-labs/services/tree/staging/apps/api). It allows the campaign admin to update information about the campaign like the geoblock list and the hidden option.\r\n\r\n### Challenges and security concerns\r\n\r\nSince our launch, we’ve been fortunate to accommodate many campaigns, which have led to a significant increase in both the number of daily visitors and the volume of requests processed. We discovered that thousands of users could simultaneously check their eligibility for a specific campaign, potentially resulting in thousands of active database connections at the same time. Additionally, several projects expressed interest in integrating our contracts and backend services into their custom claim pages. However, we found that these integrators often neglected the efficiency of their calls to our API endpoints.\r\n\r\nAlthough we obfuscated our server routes using Vercel API Routes and validated referrer headers, some integrators bypassed these safeguards by directly calling the Vercel routes and spoofing the referrer headers. Beyond integrators, we also detected bots attempting to check the eligibility of hundreds of thousands of addresses per minute. Finally, we encountered several DDoS attacks specifically targeting our API routes, with a focus on the eligibility endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Security systems\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, we decided early on to obfuscate the API routes in the app, which we achieved using Vercel API Routes. Additionally, in our eligibility check system, we introduced Google reCAPTCHA verification, ensuring that a token is validated before any API request is performed. To mitigate excessive requests, we implemented a rate limiter that allows up to 50,000 unique IPs to make a maximum of 200 requests every 15 minutes ([details](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-rate-limit)).\r\n\r\nBoth the Node.js and Rust backend services utilize Bearer Tokens, ensuring that calls from unauthorized parties are blocked.\r\n\r\nTo further address DDoS and bot attacks, we began leveraging the [Vercel Firewall](https://vercel.com/docs/security/vercel-waf). We implemented rate-limiting rules that track both IP addresses and the JA4 Digest (helpful in cases where attackers frequently change their IP addresses) for our eligibility and hidden routes. These rules restrict users to a maximum of 20 requests per 60 seconds. You can review the complete firewall configuration and analytics [here](https://vercel.com/sablier/client/firewall).\r\n\r\n### Backend Scaling\r\n\r\nWe strive to provide the best user experience (UX) for very large campaigns, potentially accommodating campaigns with over 1 million recipients. Achieving this goal requires addressing several scaling challenges. First, given the high volume of requests—not only those from users checking their eligibility for specific campaigns but also automated requests such as those for the \"Claimable\" tab and hidden campaigns—we must support a significant number of simultaneous database connections. To tackle this, we started using [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/accelerate) with our PostgreSQL database, which allows us to manage up to ~100~ 1000 parallel database connections effectively. Unfortunately, achieving this with Prisma Accelerate introduced some limitations during write operations. These limitations caused issues with preprocessing recipient Merkle Proofs in the database and imposed a maximum size per query. To address these challenges, we decided to split the Node.js server into two separate services with distinct responsibilities:\r\n\r\n- `processor`: This service handles event listening and campaign processing. It does not use Prisma Accelerate to avoid any limitations during write operations and does not require multiple simultaneous database connections.\r\n- `api`: This service uses Prisma Accelerate and is responsible for all READ requests, such as eligibility checks, retrieving eligible data, hidden campaigns, and campaign details.\r\n\r\nWhile this solution is currently effective, we should consider other infrastructure options, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), to accommodate new, large-scale campaigns. \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the initial .csv processing is performed by a Rust serverless function hosted on Vercel. However, Vercel's serverless functions have a maximum request body size limit of 4.5 MB, which prevents users from uploading larger .csv files. To overcome this limitation, we need to change our hosting environment for the Rust services. AWS Lambda, for instance, allows a maximum payload size of 6 MB for synchronous invocations, which offers a slight improvement and also on AWS be can host a RUST traditional server that does not have any body size limitations . Despite this, even AWS Lambda may not fully meet our needs for very large campaigns. \r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/engineers please feel free to provide any feedback or ideas to improve our current system.\r\n","createdAt":"2025-01-22T21:46:10Z","labels":[],"number":1338,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Airdrops backend services present and future needs","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-03-04T00:23:30Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1338"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"We've had users ask us for more metrics related to the Airstream campaigns.

Charge a fixed fee in USDC\n2. Charge a percentage fee in whatever token is streamed (via the `broker` parameter)\n\nI imagine that the 2nd option would be easier to implement, but it might not appeal to our users' preferences. That is, users may prefer to pay in USDC despite streaming FOO tokens (easier for accounting).

Consistency for consistency's sake is a good default explanation, but I have suggested what I think it's a better explanation for this particular context, which overrides the default explanation. That is, due to the persistent nature of Flow streams, the action buttons matter much more than the informational sections under \"Attributes\".\r\n2. Consistency is irrelevant for Vesting users who do not use Payment streams, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nBut then, here's an idea — **what if we also moved the actions tab at the top in the Lockup stream profile**?\r\n\r\nThen, about this:\r\n\r\n> People will not miss that action panel, it's one scroll away and it's in plain sight\r\n\r\n- It's not one scroll away, at least not on my MacBook Air 13\", and not on mobile.\r\n- It's not in plain sight, at least not by the modern standards of attention spans. There's nothing flashy about those buttons.\r\n\r\n> data about the stream seems more important for setting context and may interest more people, since actions are geared towards recipients and senders\r\n\r\nThat's a fair point. But because the actions tab is shorter, the _Attributes_ would be seen regardless. Whereas now, the _Actions_ are buried.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, isn't our incentive to nudge users toward performing actions with streams?

Most Sablier users (present and future) would have similar requirements, i.e., to be able to borrow against the streams that mature in the future. No platform like Opensea or NFTfi could solve this problem efficiently. Even in the case of a non-cancelable stream, they would remain slow because of their P2P nature.\r\n\r\nThis creates a gap and opens up a new opportunity to create a new kind of liquidity protocol. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nA new liquidity platform that allows recipients to borrow against their Stream.\r\n\r\n- The borrowed token is the same as the underlying token of the stream.\r\n- The platform uses a mathematical equation to determine the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio based on the stream parameters such as maturity date, underlying token, and cancellability.\r\n- The protocol would be decentralized, of course.\r\n- Interest rates would be determined by the demand and supply (similar to Aave).\r\n- This would not be a P2P platform but a platform with unified liquidity. Lenders will pool in different tokens and loans will originate from that common pool. \r\n- Since, the collateral gets freed in the future, instead of allowing lenders to withdraw liquidity at any time, it would be more like a fixed yield protocol where lenders lock in their tokens for a fixed period for fixed interest rates. \r\n\r\nThis solves two problems for stream owners:\r\n1. Instant liquidity\r\n2. Predictable interest rates\r\n\r\n## Risk for lenders\r\nIn the case of a non-cancelable stream, there is absolutely 0 risk for lenders (other than smart contract risk). Since we will build this platform, we can decide to not allow cancelable streams to borrow.\r\n\r\n## Alternate revenue model\r\nThis could also become an alternate source of revenue for Sablier. There would be a commission from the interest and there could be arbitrage between guaranteed fixed yield to lenders and what it actually receives from borrowers.\r\n\r\n## Side note\r\nIt is inspired by the below discussions:\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/2#discussioncomment-8306570\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/684\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/12\r\n\r\nThis is just an idea for temperature check around this.

For Polynomial, it's a weekly campaign, where the sender defines a list of recipients and creates a week-long claim campaign. After the week ends, they re-compute the eligible addresses and create a new campaign.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Since it hasn't been requested nor does it have a lot of use-cases yet, it's not a very urgent thing, but a feature to consider long-term. If it proves to be technically and algorithmically viable.\r\n\r\n## Idea\r\n\r\nWhat if we were to allow users to update the merkle tree of recipients, in an append-only fashion?\r\n\r\n## Implementation (idea)\r\n\r\nThe sender would have access to an `append(newRoot, proof, ...other)` feature that would do the following:\r\n- It needs to prove that the `oldRoot` is now a `leaf` in the new tree at a given new `index`. Therefore, it performs [`MerkleProof.verify(newRoot, proof, oldRoot)`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/cryptography#MerkleProof-verify-bytes32---bytes32-bytes32-) to make sure the old claims are still part of the tree\r\n- It replaces the root, total amount and recipient count (defined as ...other in the method above for simplicity) in the contract, as well as updates the ipfsHash\r\n\r\nThis relies on a few technicalities I'm not yet sure of but laying out here for research:\r\n- The tree has to still be valid after building the new one (where the old tree is now a branch)\r\n- This functionality is append only, meaning old allocations will remain intact\r\n- Indexes for new leafs will start from the last index used in the old merkle tree (so we can still do our `claim(index, recipient, amount, merkleProof)`)\r\n- Our systems can support multi-address claims. It will require our app and backend services to:\r\n   - allow for multiple claims from the same address\r\n   - enable a different IPFS file structure and enable re-indexing of a campaign once an `append` is performed\r\n- We also implement a `multiClaim` using Open Zeppelin's [`multiProofVerify`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/495a287e9ab38afe8ed165b767a8a901fc47c5fb/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol#L178) for good UX\r\n\r\n## Thoughts\r\n\r\nThis system would allow projects that do recurring rewards to avoid segregating their assets in multiple campaigns, if those campaigns share similar characteristics and distribution models. \r\n\r\nIt would also allow projects that fail to include certain addresses in one of their distributions to fix that - although since it's an append only feature, it wouldn't help in case they need to take away or subtract from someone's unclaimed allocation.\r\n\r\nAnyway, feasible or not, at the very least a fun engineering exercise.\r\n\r\nCC: @sablier-labs/engineers ","createdAt":"2025-01-26T14:04:37Z","labels":[],"number":99,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"open","title":"Continous reward campaigns (fmr. appending to the recipient list in airdrops)","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-08-07T15:41:12Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/99"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"User request from this [tweet](https://x.com/Barabazs_/status/1946232545923715151).\r\n\r\nThe pricing-based rule would be **additive** to the time-based rule - whichever of the following conditions gets hit faster, the asset is unlocked:\r\n\r\n1.

Referral programs have proven effective in driving organic growth by incentivizing existing users to onboard new customers.\r\n\r\nTo align with our strategic goals, we propose building a centralized referral system initially, with the potential to transition to an on-chain solution in the future. This phased approach ensures cost-effectiveness and ease of implementation while allowing us to test and optimize the program before scaling.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Details\r\n\r\n1.\tReferral Program Framework:\r\n•\tStructure: A centralized system where users can refer new customers and earn a share of the fees generated by their referrals.\r\n•\tIncentives: A percentage of transaction fees (exact percentage to be determined) will be distributed to the referrers based on the activity of their referrals.\r\n•\tEligibility: Open to all users with verified accounts to maintain program integrity.\r\n•\tDistribution: The user must click a claim button to withdraw earned rewards. \r\n\r\n2.\tInitial Implementation:\r\n\r\n•\tCentralized Approach: The system will be built and maintained in-house to minimize costs and enable quicker iterations.\r\n•\tEase of Use: Simple referral links or codes will be generated for users to share, making onboarding seamless for new customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tBest Practices and Inspiration:\r\n•\tGMX Implementation: GMX’s referral program is a leading example of a sustainable and user-friendly system. We will study and incorporate their best practices, such as tiered rewards and transparency in fee sharing.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f988a28c-cbfa-4638-b082-10be8d284550\"/>\r\n\r\n•\tSaas Services: While on-chain referral Saas solutions are available, feedback indicates they are cost-prohibitive. Our in-house approach offers a lean alternative with room to evolve into an on-chain model if the program proves successful.\r\n\r\n4.\tFuture Roadmap:\r\n•\tTesting and Iteration: Use the centralized system as a pilot to gather data on user behavior, referral effectiveness, and overall program impact.\r\n•\tOn-Chain Transition: Explore on-chain referral program providers or develop an in-house solution as our user base grows and on-chain technologies become more cost-efficient.\r\n\r\n## Expected Benefits\r\n\r\n•\tIncreased User Acquisition: Leverage the community’s network to bring in new customers.\r\n•\tEnhanced Fee Revenue: Drive higher transaction volumes through incentivized referrals.\r\n•\tCost Efficiency: Launch a lean system while avoiding the high costs of existing on-chain solutions.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nA centralized referral program aligns with our growth objectives and provides a scalable foundation to incentivize user acquisition. By adopting best practices from industry leaders like GMX and iterating on our own system, we can maximize the program’s impact while maintaining cost control. This initiative represents a valuable step toward building a stronger, more engaged community.\r\n\r\nNext Steps:\r\n1.\tDefine the program’s fee-sharing structure.\r\n2.\tDesign and develop the centralized referral platform.\r\n3.\tLaunch a pilot program and monitor performance metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/everybody","createdAt":"2024-12-11T13:51:28Z","labels":[],"number":92,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"open","title":"Implementing an automated referral program for fee sharing","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-08-05T17:21:09Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/92"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Basically, do what [offx.tech](https://offx.tech/) does but for Sablier streams.\r\n\r\nThere is market demand for this - recently a Sablier user has been scammed while transferring ownership of an NFT.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"222\" alt=\"SCR-20240814-plhx\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c449e40a-06d1-4743-9c0a-fe03b6085f2f\">\r\n\r\nA proper platform would facilitate a safe transaction via an escrow account.\r\n\r\nThis can be a highly lucrative source of revenues for Sablier.\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/everybody.","createdAt":"2024-08-14T14:53:23Z","labels":[],"number":66,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"OTC app for trading Sablier streams","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-08-05T11:58:03Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/66"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The idea is to charge a $1 fee upon transferring NFTs.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to withdrawals and claims, this is a business transaction.

People use it for payroll, you could even envision a credit system relying on future income, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's a tough market, and it really depends on how far you're willing to go when it comes to profit.\r\n\r\nThere are two approaches to issuing a payment card.\r\n\r\n## White Label\r\n\r\nThe easiest, quickest, and cheapest approach from our end, is simply to make a deal with a company like [Gnosis Pay](https://gnosispay.com), and get a whitelabel solution done for us where we offer a Sablier card that relies on Gnosis Pay's infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage of being incredibly cheap, given most of the work has already been done for us, and it's very quick thanks to that same reason. The question becomes, how much profit would we generate in that case? Practically nothing.\r\n\r\nThe margins in these types of partnerships are usually around ~0.05% per transaction, at least in the EU. In the US the margins are slightly higher as there is less regulation, but it's still not enormous. So if someone spends $1K using our card, we get $0.50, which isn't much. The average Europoor consumer spends around ~$600-800 per month using their payment cards, resulting in about $0.30-0.40 per consumer, per month, on average, if we were to serve EU customers exclusively as an example. And you still have to pay taxes on that.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to get 1,000 EU users to use this card exclusively, that's merely ~$350/month in revenue. It's not worth it, or at least not worth it with just transaction fees. You could think of a subscription, but who is going to pay a subscription when they can just port their money over to Gnosis Pay or a competitor in one transaction, and pay zero fees?\r\n\r\n## An Independent Sablier Card\r\n\r\nBuilding your own stack has the advantage you make the user experience just as you like, price just as you like, etc. but it's long, and it's expensive to build. Building a card business from the ground up is a ton of regulations to comply with (will probably cost us hundreds of thousands of $ in lawyer fees), involves KYC processes, and people are always trying to game your system to defraud you through chargeback tricks, fake KYC, etc.\r\n\r\nWe can do it, but it's not going to be what I would define as \"fun\". The margins are higher, though. But it's a lot of work.\r\n\r\n## The Right Way to Think About a Sablier Card\r\n\r\nIf we issue a card, it won't be for profit, or at least at first. It's a retention mechanism. And importantly, it gets people to keep their money within Sablier. Money that, theoretically, we can monetize down the road by lending it, etc.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the right approach is probably to get a deal done with [Gnosis Pay](https://gnosispay.com) or a similar actor like [Stripe Issuing](https://stripe.com/issuing), go white label, and see if it has any interest from users. If we eventually get sufficient traction, we can go our own way and build our own solution from the ground up. But until then, it's purely a retention mechanism.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/everybody ","createdAt":"2025-04-25T19:29:06Z","labels":[],"number":147,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"open","title":"An Overview of Crypto Payment Card Models","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-07-26T11:36:17Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/147"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Keywords: indexer, graph, the graph, envio, shipping speed, prioritization\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nRelying on a single indexer makes a web3 UI fragile. If the indexer goes down, users can no longer see the latest status of the application, despite the blockchain itself working correctly.\r\n\r\nCase in point: on July 11, 2025, Safe experienced  [major downtime](https://x.com/safe/status/1943682189285314588).\r\n\r\n## Current Solution\r\n\r\nIn response to this problem, @razgraf and @gavriliumircea came up with a solution that involves running two different indexing vendors: Envio and The Graph.\r\n\r\n## Problems with Current Solution\r\n\r\n- **Very expensive in terms of engineering hours.** Maintaining both the Envio and The Graph mappings is a full-time job. We're paying ~five figures' worth of a software engineer's salary just to maintain the status quo every year.\r\n   - The Graph uses AssemblyScript, which makes code reuse impossible.\r\n- **The Graph has become utterly unreliable.** Our Lockup indexer is failing, and they have no idea why (we've been in limbo for over 4 days now!).\r\n    - There are a dozen other issues with The Graph, though. See my thread on X for a collection of complaints: [Hate to say it, but The Graph feels like an abandoned project](https://x.com/PaulRBerg/status/1943321496358666693).\r\n\r\n## New Solution\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee095aa8-fc78-4bed-8d96-89867cade1cc\"/>\r\n\r\nThe key insight is to zoom in on the original problem - **we merely need a fallback data API**. We don't need multiple vendors - the fallback API can be based on the same software.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Run a fallback Envio indexer for each protocol. This can be done in the following ways:\r\n    1. Create a duplicate indexer for each protocol in the Hosted Service. This will increase our Envio subscription cost, but it'd be totally worth it.\r\n    2. Self-host Envio.\r\n    3. Ask Envio to host our indexer on a bare-metal server (on top of Hosted). Envio quoted ~$1k/month.\r\n- [x] In each Envio indexer, use multiple RPC as fallback (I've already implemented this in [my refactor PR](https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/pull/92))\r\n- [ ] Phase out The Graph.\r\n    - Use Envio as the primary data provider in the UI.\r\n    - Move The Graph mappings to a fallback branch, and purge them from the main branch.\r\n    - Except for bugs, stop maintaining The Graph mappings.\r\n    - As soon as we implement a new feature/product, remove The Graph as a data API in the UI.\r\n- [ ] Eventually, some integrations like Snapshot will break, but that's fine. We will update them to use Envio, or reconsider if we truly need them (if they have users).\r\n\r\n### All Chains Supported\r\n\r\nEnvio HyperSync is not available on all chains where Sablier is deployed to, but this is not a problem.\r\n\r\nAs explained [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/issues/140#issuecomment-3069946544), we can use a standard RPC server as a data provider. This will make the absolute indexing slow (from the beginning), but not the at-the-head indexing, i.e., once a user creates a stream, they will see it shortly in the UI.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as Dmitry told me in a private TG chat, vanilla RPC might be even more efficient for at-the-head indexing.\r\n\r\n## Mindset\r\n\r\n✅ Spend more time shipping new features instead of obscure AssemblyScript code\r\n✅ Accept a modicum of downtime from time-to-time\r\n✅ Be mindful of our runway\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> At this point, I genuinely believe that even if we don't run any fallback Envio indexers, running Envio alone (as it currently stands) and getting rid of The Graph will lead to higher uptime in our UI. The Graph went down so many times it's become a joke at this point. Indexing speed is so slow. Customer support is so bad. Making new deployments is a pain. Let's get over it, treat it as a sunk cost, and focus on shipping more stuff.\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/frontend, especially @razgraf and @gavriliumircea.\r\n\r\n### Related\r\n\r\n- [Envio-only approach to speed up development of our future EVM products](https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/discussions/149))","createdAt":"2025-07-14T15:22:01Z","labels":[],"number":171,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"open","title":"Enviofication","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-07-17T19:17:16Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/171"},{"author":"maxdesalle","body":"We've received several requests the past few months from users asking if they could create their new token directly on Sablier, or if we could refer them to someone that could do this for them.

Though we focus on *token* distribution, a mission that would logically include Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\r\n\r\nThere has been repeated demand to be able to either vest, or at the very least timelock NFTs (vesting would require fractionalizing NFTs which is probably sub-ideal).\r\n\r\nRecently, [Infinex](https://infinex.xyz/), [Kain Warwick](https://x.com/kaiynne)'s ([Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) founder) new exchange platform, organized a token sale where they sold \"Patron NFTs\", NFTs that can be used to vote in the governance mechanism of Infinex. They are vesting these NFTs to buyers, in the following way: if you bought 1, it's unlocked after 2 years. If you bought 2, the first one is unlocked after 1 year, the second one after 2 years. If you bought 3, the first after 8 months, second 16 months, third after 2 years (24 months).

They have several requirements, one of which being to have the grants be automatically created every quarter based on some KPIs from their P-chain. They said that they can provide an API for the P-chain data.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution would be to obtain custody of the $AVAX tokens and manually create the streams using CSV files. However, I doubt that they would be happy to do this, and it would also be risky from a compliance perspective (we would become literal custodians).\r\n\r\nThus, we have to build something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Write a smart contract called `StreamCreator`.\r\n2. Ava Labs ERC-20 approves the `StreamCreator` contract to spend up to $40M worth of $AVAX.\r\n3. The logic in `StreamCreator` should be similar to [`BatchLockup`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/53ef5006a436ba9586b677c92c96644467279cec/src/periphery/SablierBatchLockup.sol), but should instead source the funds from Ava Labs not from `msg.sender`.\r\n4. Write an offchain script that parses the P-chain data and converts it into ABI-encoded function calls that can be passed to `StreamCreator`.\r\n5. Batch-create the streams (perhaps using another offchain script).\r\n\r\nThis is a sophisticated feature because they have to trust us that the grants will be created correctly, so we should hand them an enterprise-level quote, and they should also subsidize the audit and the gas costs.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nCC @sablier-labs/engineers.

The first one, Pectra, is right around the corner, Fusaka should come by the end of the year, and Glamsterdam should arrive in early 2026. All three upgrades will offer **massive** improvements in user experience. Pectra enables account abstraction, implying the ability to swap a token in 1 transaction, batch transactions for EOAs, etc.\r\n\r\nAll three also massively scale blobs to make layer-2s as cheap as possible, while Fusaka and Glamsterdam will also [significantly improve the scalability of Ethereum itself](https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1915707657685500134), to the point that transaction fees probably won't be something we talk that much about anymore in crypto.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we're seeing massive improvements in user experience within crypto apps. [Infinex](https://infinex.xyz/), a non-custodial Binance competitor, allows you to create an account in one click using passkeys. It doesn't support logging in with a third-party wallet, doesn't have seed phrases or passwords, etc. [Parifi](https://app.parifi.org/), a Sablier customer that recently launched, allows you to log in with your email address.\r\n\r\nWith account abstraction, [we're also seeing the end of ETH as the gas token](https://x.com/Tyler_Did_It/status/1915500870164238701). Users can now pay for transaction fees in USDC, etc. \r\n\r\nFinally, we're also seeing the rise of onchain equities. Examples include the success of tokens like [PAXG](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pax-gold) or [XAUT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether-gold), that have allowed investors to invest in gold via crypto. Another example is the recent launch of an [onchain SAFE framework](https://x.com/MetaLeX_Labs/status/1915498118352609337) for company fundraising. You can also invest in the SP500, Coinbase, NVIDIA, Tesla, etc. [completely onchain](https://backed.fi/).\r\n\r\n## The End to End Onchain Equity Platform\r\n\r\nMost tokens will inevitably evolve into equity tokens, either representing real company shares or direct claims on protocol revenues. Until now, tokens were mostly governance-based, but without revenues, governance is irrelevant. The endgame is equity.\r\n\r\nSteve Jobs captured the essence of good product design:\r\n\r\n> *You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You can't start with the technology and try to figure out where you’re going to sell it.* — Steve Jobs\r\n\r\nHistorically, crypto was limited by wallets, transaction fees, and bad UX. Within a year, these barriers will disappear. For the first time, we can build for the actual end-user experience, not just the best crypto could offer.\r\n\r\nIn a world of onchain equities, users will need compliant token launches (including an onchain SAFE if needed, for example), flexible token distribution (vesting, airdrops, ICOs like [Dutch auctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction)), and ways to allocate tokens for grants and incentives.\r\n\r\nSablier is perfectly positioned to dominate this market. We already have a significant part of the needed infrastructure, we have the experience, and we have the traction needed to expand.\r\n\r\nThe end user experience for Sablier is very simple: user logs in with their email or passkey in Sablier, no wallets. What is even a wallet? In a few clicks, they launch their token on Sablier with a lot of possible customization. They are then directly offered the ability to vest, airdrop, etc. their token. If they want to, a fundraising marketplace is directly available on Sablier itself, allowing users to invest in tokens via ICOs etc. in a completely non-custodial way, via Sablier. They can also distribute their dividends through Sablier, of course.\r\n\r\nAnd obviously, the vesting, etc. happens **within** Sablier, meaning each Sablier \"account\" has an integrated wallet tied to the email address or passkey. Users still have the ability to vest to other wallets by enabling the \"advanced mode\" in the settings etc. but by default, everything happens within Sablier. This allows us to maximize retention. Everything happens *within* Sablier. We keep all the liquidity, and we keep all the monetization ability.\r\n\r\nIf users prefer, they can create their token elsewhere and use Sablier purely for distribution or fundraising.\r\n\r\n## The Alpha: Roadmap Implications\r\n\r\n1. **Our fee system is broken:** users to have to pay fees in ETH to claim or withdraw funds, while 1. if they pay fees themselves, they will probably pay them in USDC or something (**[and this is starting next month!!!](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/04/02/ethereum-developers-lock-in-may-7-for-pectra-upgrade)**), and 2. most of them will probably not even end up paying fees themselves, it will be sponsored by the wallet they use, given this will act as a retention mechanism for wallets, and fees will be so cheap it won't matter anyway.\r\n\r\n2. **We need to launch a token launcher product:** either aquire [CreateMyToken](https://www.createmytoken.com/), or build something ourselves from the ground up. After our Series A, our focus should be on building a token sale solution within Sablier, further expanding our token distribution offering, and greatly expanding our monetization ability.\r\n\r\n3. **We should change the user experience in our app:** by default, users should log in with email / passkey (his is already possible today), and only optionally consider logging in via a third-party wallet like Metamask, Rainbow, etc. When senders enter recipient data, it should only be optional to enter an ETH address, by default it should be an email address, inviting the recipient to create a Sablier account using their email, tied to a passkey.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/everybody ","createdAt":"2025-04-26T15:01:12Z","labels":[],"number":148,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"open","title":"The Future of Sablier: Building Our Way to a $100 Billion Company","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-05-08T16:33:48Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/148"},{"author":"maxdesalle","body":"On a call with the founder of [Myso](https://www.myso.finance/), an idea came to mind to allow for **more flexibility when it comes to NFT usage**.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, it's in our best interest to have as much usage with regards to stream NFTs as possible. **The reason is simple:** the more activity we have, the more integrations we have, the larger our moat becomes, the harder it will be for a competitor to emerge.\r\n\r\nCurrently, and I speak from experience here as I have the chance of often interacting with users, **for vesting streams, most people choose to have them set as untransferable**. And that's obviously because the organizations creating those streams want to avoid recipients selling their streams on OpenSea, or other NFT marketplaces.\r\n\r\n**So we are left with two extremes:** either the stream creator completely blocks transferability and the recipient cannot do anything with the stream, or they completely allow transferability and the recipient can do anything they want.\r\n\r\n**What if there was a middle-ground?**\r\n\r\nOne could think of a system where **the stream creator could allow only certain protocols to interact with the NFT**. For example, they could allow [Myso](https://www.myso.finance/) to interact with the NFT to allow their recipients to get a loan using their vesting schedules as collateral, but obviously not allow OpenSea to interact with it.\r\n\r\nWe could build a system similar to how Snapshot built its \"strategy\" voting system, where we build the general framework, and third-parties who are interested (like [Myso](https://myso.finance), for example) integrate.

As a result of this, these tokens are not indistinguishable from ERC20 standard. Sablier protocol can behave unexpectedly if these tokens are involved.\r\n\r\n**Affected chains supported by Sablier**\r\n\r\n- [Tangle's TNT](https://explorer.tangle.tools/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000802): implements `approve`, `transfer` and `balanceOf` functions.\r\n- [Polygon's POL](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010): implements `transfer` and `balanceOf` functions. It does not implement `approve`.\r\n\r\n**Affected chains not yet supported by Sablier**\r\n\r\n- [CELO](https://celoscan.io/token/0x471ece3750da237f93b8e339c536989b8978a438): implements `approve`, `transfer` and `balanceOf` functions.\r\n- [METIS](https://explorer.metis.io/address/0xDeadDeAddeAddEAddeadDEaDDEAdDeaDDeAD0000): implements `approve`, `transfer` and `balanceOf` functions.\r\n- [Moonbeam's GLMR](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/erc20/): implements `approve`, `transfer` and `balanceOf` functions.\r\n\r\n## Problems and Mitigations\r\n\r\nBecause they act both as ERC20 and native tokens, they return the same value for `balanceOf` and `address(this).balance`. This would lead to the following consequences:\r\n\r\n### Lockup and Flow\r\n\r\nIf a user streams any of the affected tokens, anybody can call [`collectFee`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/blob/staging/src/abstracts/SablierLockupBase.sol#L350) and send the entire token balance to the admin, including the stream's balance.\r\n\r\n#### Solution:\r\n\r\n- Restrict `collectFee` to only be callable by the protocol admin.\r\n\r\nBoth Lockup and Flow accepts deposit through `approve` and `transferFrom`. Therefore, tokens affecting these two protocols are TNT, CELO and METIS. POL is not affected since it does not implement `approve` and cannot be used with.\r\n\r\n### Airdrop Campaigns\r\n\r\nCampaigns accept deposit through direct ERC20 transfers. Therefore, in case a campaign is created with any of the affected tokens, there are two issues that can be faced:\r\n\r\n1. The campaign creator can use `clawback` to withdraw the unclaimed funds including the fee accrued.\r\n2. Anybody can call `collectFee` and send the entire token balance to the admin, including the users' funds.\r\n\r\n#### Solution:\r\n\r\n- Restrict `collectFee` to only be callable by the protocol admin.\r\n- Disable native tokens at the UI level so that users cannot create campaigns with them. Though they can still use the contract directly to create campaigns but it will be difficult because of the Merkle tree requirement.\r\n- Do nothing with `clawback` since each campaign is localised so the loss to Sablier admin is minimal, even if the campaign creator withdraw fee accrued. Handling it in `clawback` would be an overkill as we will have to implement a new function to handle deposits, then track deposits and claims in a storage variable.\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/engineers.\r\n\r\nNote: This was originally disclosed by [Eric](https://x.com/shw9453) during [Cantina finding](https://cantina.xyz/code/c9980035-706a-4119-91fe-7ebddaf123e4/findings/11) and discussed [here](https://cantina.xyz/code/c9980035-706a-4119-91fe-7ebddaf123e4/comments#comment-d1f8ade0-ac9e-4cfd-817b-e9e3640a8c65).","createdAt":"2025-03-13T19:15:11Z","labels":[],"number":115,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Chains with ERC20 functions implemented in native tokens","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T10:11:36Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/115"},{"author":"IaroslavMazur","body":"Looking at the Hedgey contracts, I've noticed that they require an optionally-filled `Donation` parameter to be passed when creating token-claiming Campaigns.\r\nWhile Sablier has got the at-Stream-creation fee in mind for the future, wdyt about offering our Streamers the opportunity to optionally donate a part of the tokens they're depositing into the newly-created Stream to Sablier?\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- the amount/percentage of the donated tokens doesn't have to be the same across all of the Streamers (as it will be when the admin fee is enabled in the future)\r\n- the donated tokens can be vested/streamed themselves (as Hedgey does), instead of being transferred to Sablier directly (potentially,\r\n- increasing the amount of tokens our clients would be comfortable allocating for us over a bigger timeframe)\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n- a slightly increased cost of executing the txs that contain the optional donation","createdAt":"2023-11-04T17:53:30Z","labels":[],"number":8,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Let Sablier users optionally donate a part of the streamed tokens to Sablier?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-16T09:32:56Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/8"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problems\r\n\r\n### Problem 1: UI Self-Checkout\r\n\r\nSometime in Q2 or Q3, we will add support for self-checkout in the UI.\r\n\r\nHowever, to provide an automated self-checkout, we need to be able to call the following functions programmatically:\r\n\r\n- [`setCustomFeeUSD`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/blob/cb91519b8328afbc9d3b474cbbd00c03ea2e474b/src/abstracts/SablierFactoryMerkleBase.sol#L74) (in the Merkle factories)\r\n- [`lowerMinFeeUSD`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/blob/cb91519b8328afbc9d3b474cbbd00c03ea2e474b/src/abstracts/SablierMerkleBase.sol#L192) (in existing Merkle campaigns)\r\n\r\nOn chains where the admin is a multisig, we cannot call the functions programmatically (due to the requirement to sign the txs), and on chains where the admin is an EOA, it would be a bad idea to store the deployer's private key in an API endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Problem 2: Fee Management and Consolidation\r\n\r\n@smol-ninja has recently created a script for [automating the fee collection](https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/issues/118).\r\n\r\nThe script is nice, but collecting the fees is just one part of the equation. The other part is how they are _managed_ and _consolidated_ after they are collected. As of now, the fees can only be collected to the admin address, and since the admin is a multisig, we cannot automate the bridging or selling of fees to USDC.\r\n\r\n@maxdesalle pointed out this problem [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/119).\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\n### Pre-Requisite\r\n\r\nA pre-requisite for all solutions is to [Add a `to` parameter in the `collectFees` function](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/139).\r\n\r\n### Solution 1: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\r\n\r\nOpenZeppelin provides a [Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/access-control) mechanism for splitting a single admin into:\r\n\r\n1. A so-called 'default admin' that takes the role of the single admin.\r\n2.

Then, we would need to submit a multisig tx to call `enableModule`.\r\n\r\n### Pros and Cons\r\n\r\n- Pro: the audit cost may be lower since the Safe Module implementation may have fewer lines of code than the OpenZeppelin integration.\r\n- Con: we would need to manually submit a multisig tx to call `enableModule` every time the protocol is deployed.\r\n- Con: the solution doesn't work on the chains where we don't use a Safe multisig as an admin. We could consider moving to a Safe everywhere, but unfortunately, Safe is not available on all chains that Sablier is deployed to.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/engineers\r\n\r\nI have a preference for the 1st solution because it would avoid the cons listed above. We could avoid the manual call to `enableModule` by adding constructor args for roles.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with the proposal, I suggest implementing this in the EVM Utils repo, and batching this task together with task https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-utils/issues/10.","createdAt":"2025-04-01T13:06:47Z","labels":[],"number":135,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Better fee management with Role-Based Access Control in the EVM contracts","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T12:46:53Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/135"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"We get this feature request a lot.

However, I now realize that we may not want to get paid in whatever random shitcoins are getting airdropped.\r\n\r\nLet's just do what [Clique](https://sablier.slack.com/archives/C04UTSBU84Q/p1713384808363859) does and charge a small fee in the base asset (e.g., ETH or MATIC). Users need to have the base asset anyway to pay for gas fees, so they will treat the added fee as part of the gas fees. The dopamine hit of having just received an airdrop will well compensate for the psychological resistance against paying a fee.\r\n\r\nThe specific amount of ETH charged as a fee will vary with the dollar price of ETH, but to start with, let's go with ~0.005 ETH, which is ~$1.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I have created a GitHub issue in Lockup: https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/1032\r\n\r\n## Lockup\r\n\r\nCharging Lockup users is trickier due to the emphasis on vesting.\r\n\r\nThe first question to answer is whom to charge — the sender or the recipient? In this [separate discussion](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/71), I have explained in great detail why I think we should charge the **recipient**.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to charge recipients:\r\n\r\n1. ~Broker fees at withdrawal time: https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/1033~\r\n2. Protocol fees at withdrawal time (why haven't we thought about this before?): https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/1034\r\n\r\nSee my [comment below](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/72#discussioncomment-10548445). Only protocol fees make sense.\r\n\r\n~Currently, Lockup supports neither broker nor protocol fees at withdraw time. I suggest implementing them both, for maximum optionality. For instance, even we might prefer to use protocol fees instead of broker fees (as doing so would reduce gas consumption), having the broker fee as a payment option wouldn't hurt. It might incentivize integrations and make it easier to offer automated withdrawals as a service.~\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nRFC @sablier-labs/everybody","createdAt":"2024-09-04T12:15:45Z","labels":[],"number":72,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Fleshing out the revenue models for H1 2025","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T14:53:21Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/72"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"## Context\r\n\r\nWe've received this feedback from Shell Protocol, a project that recently launched their token using Sablier (with their own version of Airstreams).

We'd \"nest\" another NFTDescriptor inside the render function of the first one.\r\n2.

This ranges from adding their logos on our pages, to including custom links or steps (e.g. checkbox for their ToS at claim) as additional functionality.\r\n\r\n## The questions\r\n\r\n1. Should we do it? Is it in our interest?\r\n2. How should we do it, and how extensive?\r\n\r\n## The idea (as seen from the airstream creator's point of view)\r\n\r\nWhen you launch a vesting program or an airdrop/token-distribution to your community, it's \"all about you\". You want your project to be the one in the spotlight, so it's fair to want your logo and product be showcased up and front.\r\n\r\nHaving it there means users do less mental gymnastics to associate the claim interface with your product (as they can see the logo there). It means you can \"appropriate\" that utility software (Sablier) as part of your own stack and only focus on your brand when you plan on how/what to communicate to users. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to this last point, if you do chose to include this utility software in your marketing, you can use their image and clout as a vote of confidence (an endorsement) **especially** if you're one of the few displayed directly in their interface.\r\n\r\nLastly, if you need \"custom features\" (functional, more than just branding e.g., the ToS checkbox suggestions) you can rely on this utility vendor (Sablier) to implement them.\r\n\r\n### The solution\r\n\r\nLet's discuss possible solutions in this thread.

We will definitely continue pursuing that goal for a while, but eventually, we will need to ask ourselves the difficult question:\r\n\r\nIf Sablier V2 keeps being used chiefly for vesting (or only for vesting), should we update our branding to reflect this?\r\n\r\nWe don't need to answer this now — just food for thought for later. V3 will definitely influence our thinking on this topic (a lot).\r\n\r\n## Takeaways\r\n\r\nThis is what we could do in the short term:\r\n\r\n1. Build dedicated pages in the landing page website:\r\n    - sablier.com/vesting\r\n    - sablier.com/payroll\r\n    - sablier.com/airdrops\r\n    - etc.\r\n2. Turn those pages into articles for additional SEO\r\n\r\nAll pages have the same layout structure, just with different labels. The purposes would be:\r\n\r\n- SEO\r\n- Shilling it to particular users who are only interested in one use case. Easier to speak the user's \"tongue\" rather than present it in terms of streams, which are more abstract\r\n\r\nHowever, building dedicated Next.js functionality in the Sablier UI at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com) that differs only in the labels would be overkill. I would much rather channel that development effort into making more integrations.","createdAt":"2023-08-15T17:03:32Z","labels":[],"number":3,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Positioning and dedicated landing page for each use case","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-09T18:04:05Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/3"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Related: https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/708\r\n\r\nI discussed this with @andreivladbrg and @razgraf on a call earlier this month, and we concluded that keeping \"streaming\" is fine. The arguments were:\r\n\r\n- People use Sablier for more things than just streaming (e.g. payroll)\r\n- The use of the \"streaming\" terminology differentiates Sablier from the crowd (e.g. \"tweet\" vs \"post\")\r\n- We haven't received any user complaint about \"streaming\" being confusing in this way\r\n- Changing the functions will lead to a breaking change, which will make integrations more difficult\r\n\r\nHowever, I confess that I am personally still on the fence about that decision. I suspect that once we get to release V3 and [OpenEnded](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/6), more people will use that product series for payroll purposes, which will make the Lockup series primarily used for vesting purposes.\r\n\r\nThere's value in terminological clarity - it's a form of good UX.

Compared to exempting the fees onchain, this solution would require an additional API call whenever a withdrawal is made or an airdrop is claimed. This is quite a bit of overhead that may go against our preference toward minimizing the number of API requests made in the UI.\r\n2. Greater web2 attack surface — only authorized users should be allowed to call the API endpoint. We can use this bearer tokens for this, but the point remains that there's a greater attack surface in our tech stack.\r\n3. Increased gas cost for withdrawals and claims\r\n\r\nThus, I suggest sticking with using the vanilla RBAC system for now, and keeping this idea in the back of our minds if the need for an onchain tx turns out to be problematic in the self-checkout flow.","createdAt":"2025-04-01T13:27:50Z","labels":[],"number":136,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"open","title":"Stamper signatures for waiving the fees in the withdraw and claim functions","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-01T13:27:51Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/136"},{"author":"maxdesalle","body":"Right now, [the plan](https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/issues/118) is to collect fees every month into our deployer wallets, many of which are multisigs.\r\n\r\nThis is a discussion to explore the potential approaches to automate bridging those fees from all chains to one chain (like Ethereum or Arbitrum) where we hold our treasury.","createdAt":"2025-03-28T22:01:16Z","labels":[],"number":119,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Automating bridging fees after they're collected","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-01T13:08:07Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/119"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"This is a must-have in order to win more US investors as users.\r\n\r\nLexicon:\r\n\r\n- RIA = [Registered Investment Advisor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ria.asp)\r\n  - A registered investment advisor (RIA) is a financial professional firm that advises clients on securities investments and may manage their financial portfolios.

We would be the first.\r\n- It provides a good excuse for collecting email addresses — in order to keep users notified of the vesting schedule and the latest size of the redistribution pool.\r\n- It makes it possible to include the holy word `APY` on our website — providing an estimate of how many more tokens you would earn if you waited until the end of the campaign.\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I am now in favor of @smol-ninja's APY-per-token proposal explained in a comment [below](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/98#discussioncomment-11951429).\r\n\r\nThere are several ways in which the escrow pool can be designed, but to keep things simple and not fry your brains while reading this proposal, I suggest a simple design to begin with:\r\n\r\nThe additional rewards will be distributed only to those users who wait until the end of the vesting period. This way, we provide clear incentives, maintain predictable economics, and minimize gas costs.\r\n\r\nAdmins can still set an expiration time, after which claiming is no longer allowed, and all tokens can be clawed-back (including the escrow pool)\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n- Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David are each eligible for 100 $FOO today or 200 $FOO if they wait 60 days\r\n- Alice claims early after 30 days; she forfeits 50 $FOO in the escrow pool\r\n- Bob claims early after 45 days; he forfeits 25 $FOO in the escrow pool\r\n- Charlie and David claim after 60 days\r\n    - They each earn their base 200 $FOO tokens\r\n    - Plus an additional 37.5 $FOO reward\r\n    - The reward is calculated thus: $EscrowPoolSum/PatientUserCount$\r\n\r\n### Continuous Redistribution\r\n\r\nI've consulted ChatGPT O1 Pro about whether a continuous, linear redistribution of the escrow pool would be feasible (before the end time) — and it doesn't look feasible:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Toggle to see ChatGPT response</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n[Link here](https://chatgpt.com/share/67936c56-39b8-800e-ab45-263cb4a11a1a)\r\n\r\nIt's theoretically possible, but it quickly becomes unwieldy. If you try to distribute the escrow pool “continuously” in parallel with the main vesting schedule, you’d effectively be adding a second vesting layer on top of the first—one that continuously tracks and recalculates shares for every user who remains patient. Each claim would require updating not only that user’s share but also everyone else’s share, which is expensive on-chain.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, doing a single redistribution at the end is straightforward: you just see who hasn’t claimed yet, divide up the escrow, and distribute. Any partial or “dynamic” redistribution during the vesting period would explode in complexity because you’d have to handle multiple partial claims, each time adjusting future entitlements for all participants.\r\n\r\nSo practically, the best approach is to award the extra tokens once at the end of the vesting period (the simpler, single-event approach). That avoids gas-heavy bookkeeping and preserves the gamification (patient users get a final bonus).\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nThis idea was first suggested by Doug Leonard, one of our angel investors, during a board meeting held on Wednesday, Jan 22\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting feature/ product idea and I think we will all be in agreement about implementing it!!\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/everybody for feedback\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/85\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/43","createdAt":"2025-01-24T10:38:55Z","labels":[],"number":98,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"A new flavor of AVCAs with redistribution of forfeited tokens","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-03-23T11:54:24Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/98"},{"author":"maxdesalle","body":"We should absolutely 100% charge a default withdrawal fee (denominated in the gas token) at the protocol fee in Lockup and Flow, like we do for airdrops.\r\n\r\nRight now, we're providing work that has costed hundreds of thousands of $ in engineering and audit costs, for free, to competitors like TokenOps.

They always remain in `SablierMerkle`.\r\n- Linear, by-the-second vesting (for simplicity, we can further customize this if the first version becomes popular).\r\n- When a recipient claims, the unvested portion is assigned back to the campaign creator.\r\n- At the end of the campaign, the creator can claw back all remaining funds. Unlike the other contracts, clawbacks here would not be an optional feature.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- **Naming**: this Merkle contract would no longer be in the 'periphery' since it would directly hold user funds. [Maybe it's time to ditch the core vs periphery category](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/1068)?\r\n- **Hooks**: In previous versions of the protocol, this feature could have been implemented via the `onSablierLockupWithdraw` hook.

In this post, I will review the benefits, the downsides, and the implementation options.\r\n\r\nSome back-of-the-napkin estimations of the counterfactual interest we could have earned from Sablier V1.1:\r\n\r\n- Based on the [Etherscan analytics](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48?a=0xCD18eAa163733Da39c232722cBC4E8940b1D8888#tokenAnalytics), in 2023 we had an average of 3 million USDC TVL\r\n- Assume an average 5% APY over 2023\r\n- Potential revenues: $0.05 * 3m = 150k$\r\n\r\n$150k is not too shabby for just one contract over one year. Assuming a bull market, the advent of [EOES](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/6), and a little bit of luck, I could easily see this figure soar into seven figures.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n1. Additional smart contract risk. Composing two protocols like this would increase the risk of using Sablier.\r\n   - It is worth noting that both Aave and Compound have been hacked.\r\n3. We may lose some users as a result. We would have to add a warning in the UI in the stream creation receipt, smth along the lines of \"Note that your funds may be deposited in a third-party lending protocol\". Alternatively, we could put this caveat in our ToS instead of the stream creation UI (as lending user funds is pretty standard in fintech), but this wouldn't be a deterrent. Users could still infer what's going on with their deposits.\r\n  - It is also possible that some users may prefer to return to V1 or to other competitors that don't \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nI see two implementation approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Bespoke logic in V2 Core\r\n2. Bespoke logic in V2 Periphery and the Subgraphs, accompanied by ERC-20 recovery mechanism[^1] in V2 Core\r\n\r\nWe should disregard the 1st approach right off the bat because it would raise the gas costs for all the users of the protocol and increase the risk of using V2 Core (when this is not necessary).\r\n\r\nHere's what I have in mind:\r\n\r\n1. We implement a new periphery contract analogous to [`Batch`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/blob/2a426ab99e65590edb25ad8fdf13a314b2b3e94b/src/SablierV2Batch.sol) (or we rename it to something more general-purpose like `Router`)\r\n2. This periphery contract will contain a function that does three things: (i) takes a USDC deposit from users, (ii) wraps it into Aave or Compound tokens, and (iii) creates the stream via the normal flow in V2 Core.\r\n3. In V2 Core, we rely on an ERC-20 recovery mechanism to allow the admin to claim the increasing lending yields.\r\n4. In the Subgraph, we mark the streams created via this periphery contract as special (e.g., we set a `lent` flag to `true`).\r\n5. In the UI, we check if the stream is `lent`. If so, we look up the underlying asset associated with the yield token and display the former instead. For example, we display USDC instead of aUSDC.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. This design assumes a dynamically adjusting asset like Aave Tokens or Compound V3 Tokens, i.e., tokens that increase their balance in real time.\r\n2. This will initially be implemented only for certain assets, e.g., USDC and WETH, but we can extend the list over time (since nothing will need to change at the contract level).\r\n\r\n### Withdrawals\r\n\r\nThe only wrinkle in the design above is what to do at withdrawal time. There are a couple of options:\r\n\r\n1. Withdraw the yield token to the user, e.g., aUSDC.\r\n2. Modify V2 Core to handle the claiming from Aave, Compound, and so forth. This should be easy as long as there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the two assets. Ideally, this would be implemented via a modular plugin system.\r\n3. Withdraw to a relayer that implements the claim logic: take aUSDC from Sablier, give it to Aave, get UDSC from Aave, and give USDC to the user.\r\n\r\n## My Thoughts\r\n\r\nI'm in favor of this proposal; we should consider implementing it in V2.2.\r\n\r\nLending user funds would enable us to generate sustainable revenues while not creating a deterrent[^2][^3]  for business growth. My gut feeling is that most users wouldn't care about their assets being lent - after all, Sablier is providing them with a valuable on-chain service. The recent [600k USDC with a 3-year duration](https://app.sablier.com/stream/LL-1-273/) proves that Sablier saves time and money for on-chain organizations.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

Thus, it's a risk that we need to address ASAP.\r\n\r\n### Problem 1: Bull Market Worries\r\n\r\n**In a bull market with a lot of volatility, the immutable fee can lead to prospects avoiding Sablier due to fear of being overcharged.**\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n- Chiliz uses CHZ for their EVM chain, a token currently priced at ~$0.056\r\n- Chiliz sets up airdrop with a claim window duration of 3 months\r\n- At the end of month 1, CHZ quadruples in value to $0.224\r\n- Airdrop claimants in month 2 pay 4x more than than the claimants in month 1\r\n\r\nNote that this problem applies to both instant and vested airdrops — it's about the price volatility during the claim window, not during the vesting window (which is separate).\r\n\r\n### Problem 2: Bear Market Blues\r\n\r\nWhen prices go down, we may end up charging significantly less than $1, which would hurt our bottom line.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nAt the high-level, the solution is:\r\n\r\n1. On the chains where Chainlink is available, integrate it.\r\n2. On the other chains, implement one of the following sub-solutions.\r\n\r\n### Sub-Solution 1: Immutable Fee + Transparent Communication\r\n\r\n1. Keep using a hard-coded default value\r\n2. Acknowledge that the problems exist, and clearly communicate them in our docs + on BD calls.\r\n\r\n### Sub-Solution 2: Disable the Immutable Fee\r\n\r\n1. Disable the onchain fee (having a boolean flag for this in the `MerkleInstant` contract).\r\n2. Redeploy the protocol when Chainlink becomes available\r\n\r\n### Sub-Solution 3: Editable Fee (by Sablier)\r\n\r\nMake it possible to edit the fee.\r\n\r\nWe can still do this in the same contract. There would be an admin address and a boolean in the constructor that specifies whether the admin can edit the fee.\r\n\r\nThis would increase the complexity of the contract, and might trigger some users reading the contract on other chains.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nI'm torn between the sub-solutions.\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/engineers for feedback","createdAt":"2025-02-07T17:53:56Z","labels":[],"number":106,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Problems with an immutable fee in the Merkle contracts","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-02-11T12:45:15Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/106"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"### Problem\r\n\r\nAccording to the [final revenue model](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/100), it has been decided to fix the claim fee at $3, denominated in USD and rather than ETH (or native tokens).\r\n\r\nThis makes the current fee logic in the Airdrops contract unnecessary for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. At the contract level, the default fee and the custom fee can only be set in ETH, which is the minimum fee required for recipients to claim. \r\n\r\n2. Since these fees are denominated in ETH, Due to the volatility of ETH price, setting a default fee at the contract level would lead to discrepancies.\r\n    1. If the ETH's price increases, the fee charged to recipients would exceed $3.\r\n    2. If the ETH's price decreases, the Sablier UI can still enforce a $3 fee.\r\n    3. The above two statements imply that the claim fee would be `>= $3`.\r\n\r\n### Solution 1\r\n\r\nDo not set the default fee at the contract level. While this solves the issue, it also means the contract cannot enforce a fee.\r\n\r\n### Solution 2\r\n\r\nIntegrate the Chainlink Oracle in the contract. Since the UI already depends on an oracle to calculate the fee in ETH during claims, the contracts can also use Chainlink data to remain consistent with the UI.\r\n\r\n### Solution 3\r\nRemove the fee logic from the contract entirely, and only keep the `payable` modifier, similar to the implementation in Lockup and Flow.\r\n\r\n### My take\r\n\r\nI am in favour of Solution 2.

We have already received several requests for this — even before officially enabling the fees.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways to implement this feature, some more difficult than others, and I'd like to go through them in this discussion.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solutions\r\n\r\nPAYG = pay-as-you-go\r\n\r\n### 1. Retroactive PAYG\r\n\r\nPros: easy to implement\r\nCons: requires trust, manual invoicing process\r\n\r\n1. Keep the service free for all recipients associated with a particular sender\r\n2. At the end of each month, calculate how many stream withdrawals and airdrop claims were made that month (cc @maxdesalle)\r\n3. Issue an invoice and send it to the sender\r\n4. If the sender defaults on making the payment, the fee exemptions will be lifted for as long as the invoices remain unpaid\r\n\r\nOptional but nice-to-have:\r\n\r\n- Saved credit card or pre-made ERC-20 approval (for automatic charging)\r\n- Spending cap, after which the service is no longer free\r\n\r\n### 2. Proactive PAYG\r\n\r\nPro: trustless\r\nCon: difficult to implement, manual invoicing process\r\n\r\n1. Ask for an upfront payment from senders based on their estimated volume, e.g., $5000\r\n2. Redo steps 1-3 from the previous solution\r\n3. Based on the results, either refund or issue an updated invoice\r\n\r\n### 3. All-you-can-eat Fixed Subscription\r\n\r\nPro: predictable cash flow\r\nCon: difficult to implement, misses revenues from heavy users\r\n\r\n- Monthly/annual subscription via either a credit card or USDC w/ an ERC-20 approval\r\n    - This requires setting up a billing profile on Stripe or smth like it\r\n2. Integrate the billing system in the UI so that the UI checks if the recipient is associated with a sender who is a paid user\r\n3. Could be integrated as a feature of Sablier Pro (which would contain other premium features)\r\n\r\n### 4. Fixed Subscription with Retroactive PAYG (Hybrid)\r\n\r\nPro: predictable cash flow, upside capture from heavy users\r\nCons: difficult to implement\r\n\r\n- Base tier with fixed monthly/annual fee covering up to X txs\r\n- Additional tiers: Higher limits with better per-claim rates\r\n- PAYG fees for exceeding tier limit\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nMy thoughts:\r\n\r\n- Let's start with solution no. 1 since it's the easiest one to implement.\r\n- With time, we can consider switching to solution no. 4, the hybrid\r\n- I dislike solution no. 2 — it will increase the mental transaction costs for both parties (Sablier and its customer)\r\n- And I also dislike solution no. 3 — we should bill proportionally to usage\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/business\r\n\r\nRelated: [Final revenue model for Q1 2025](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/100)","createdAt":"2025-01-28T17:24:24Z","labels":[],"number":101,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"open","title":"Billing models for senders subsidizing fees for recipients","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-02-07T17:14:51Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/101"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"Opening this as a thread for requests to build Sablier on Solana.

We need a consistent approach in all revenue models.\r\n\r\n## Spillover Effect\r\n\r\nBecause we have [decided](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/67) to charge the recipient in flow and introduce a claim fee in Airstreams, we should also charge recipients in Lockup.\r\n\r\nLet's explore what would happen if we did the opposite, i.e., charge senders.\r\n\r\n1. It would create peculiar incentives. **Senders would notice that some parts of the product are free for them.** Why should they bother with creating Lockup streams when they can create an Airstream campaign and let the recipients foot the bill?\r\n2. Depending on the billing model:\r\n    - With annual subscriptions, the UI/UX would be particularly confusing. Flow and Airstreams would be free for senders, but the Vesting tab would not. It'd be odd and inconsistent, right?\r\n    - With pay-per-usage, we would run into the problems of (i) overcharged senders who cancel streams and (ii) [front-running risk](https://github.com/cantinasec/review-sablier/issues/15). Admittedly, these issues apply regardless of whether non-Lockup features are free for senders or not, but if we used them as a rationale for charging recipients in Flow, why shouldn't do the same in Lockup, too?\r\n\r\nIf we required senders to pay for Flow and Airstreams, then it would no longer make sense to charge recipients. And there you go — the spillover effect of whom is charged.\r\n\r\n## Recipient-Centricity\r\n\r\nThe rationale above has led me to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n- At the protocol level, we should only charge recipients.\r\n- At the UI level as it currently stands, we should again only charge recipients.\r\n- There are, however, some features for which it makes sense to only charge senders. To achieve this while not running afoul of the spillover effect, I suggest creating a new Sablier Pro product.\r\n\r\n## Sablier Pro\r\n\r\n- Gated by either a monthly or annual subscription model.\r\n- [Subsidizing gas fees](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/43)\r\n- Focused on vesting and airdrops. A 'pro' product for payroll is much more difficult to build as it's heavy compliance work.\r\n- Special features, e.g., [address labeling](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/discussions/986).\r\n- Airstreams with >50k recipients; basically, force senders to foot the bill whilst keeping the service free for recipients.\r\n- Basic legal and compliance support.\r\n- Enterprise support (basically, be more stingy with whom we provide support to on Telegram).\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n\r\n- Recipients associated with Sablier Pro users will need to be excluded from paying fees.\r\n- It will be impossible to exclude the same users from protocol fees in Flow, but this is not an issue because Sablier Pro wouldn't cater to payroll users anyway.\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\n- [Notion: Roadmap for 2025](https://www.notion.so/sablier/Roadmap-for-2025-f2e6a1da2cc54a1fa69f4eac26903b3b)\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/72\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/48\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/discussions/1057\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\nRFC @sablier-labs/everybody.","createdAt":"2024-09-04T12:12:52Z","labels":[],"number":71,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"The spillover effect of whom is charged — whether the sender or the recipient","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-01-27T15:20:56Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/71"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem\r\n\r\nThere have been users who have requested segregated 'segregated' vesting, i.e., using a bespoke vesting contract for their tokens in which no other tokens are deposited.\r\n\r\nI've heard two different rationales:\r\n\r\n1. **Compliance**: mentioned by Swerve, a lost user whom I talked to in 2024. They said that they needed segregation in order to comply with [RIA and QC regulations](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/81) in the US.\r\n2. **Security**: a point raised by the Term Finance team. The logic is that segregated contracts don't create honeypots.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe ideal UX would look something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Fork `Lockup` into a contract that supports only one token (potentially by sharing the logic in a new abstract contract)\r\n2. Add a boolean flag in the stream creation form: \"Do you want segregated vesting?\" (potentially hidden underneath an _Advanced_ section so that the 99% of users who don't need this feature are not required to understand what this means)\r\n3. If the user wants segregation, deploy the bespoke contract.\r\n4. In the UI, provide a unified view for the monolith streams and the bespoke contract streams (so, make these bespoke streams behave as if they were part of the same product)\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nI suggest waiting for more user requests before making any move.\r\n\r\n- It's unclear if segregation is required to comply with QC regulations. To me, it seems like a matter of 'substance over form', and yet another case of archaic legislation not being easily applicable to blockchain and smart contracts.\r\n- The security benefits of segregation are debatable. Should a bug be found in Sablier, a savvy attacker could still find all contracts with the same bytecode and exploit them. \r\n- The implementation is non-trivial (both frontend and backend).\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/everybody","createdAt":"2025-01-20T13:20:32Z","labels":[],"number":96,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Segregated vesting contracts","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-01-21T16:21:53Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/96"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"I'm opening this independent discussion because of a user who requested it.

And we know integrators have already a clear interest in regular streams, reality proved that.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** [a simple rollup has most of the upsides of v3 without any of the downsides](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2857db0-5b69-4267-a92c-0ca37521d68f).\r\n\r\n## Why the Multi-VM Strategy Is the Wrong Path\r\n\r\nThere are four major downsides to the multi-VM strategy:\r\n\r\n1. **It's very unscalable**, as it requires us to have one or multiple dedicated smart contract engineer(s) for every VM we are trying to build on. On the product side, it also requires extensive work to work with these custom VMs who use different wallet frameworks, transaction flows, etc.\r\n\r\n2. **It makes our user interface very complex**, as we now have to support different chains, with different VMs, different wallets, different transaction flows, etc. @razgraf and @gavriliumircea are true magicians, but even with their incredible work, the end user experience would probably still take a hit.\r\n\r\n3. **It's very inflexible:** we have absolutely no control over the stack we are building on, and have to abide by the design decisions of the engineering teams building those VMs. If they make bad decisions, we have to pay the costs. We have zero control.\r\n\r\n4. **It's like trying to build an app for every operating system**, having to maintain different codebases in different programming languages, and having to comply with every app store, when you could build an app (chain) that magically works with every operating system and app store.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** [multi-vm is a recipe for headaches](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44726dc4-f75b-4c3a-b7d9-f315695d4371).\r\n\r\n## Why a Simple Rollup Is Absolutely Amazing and Will Save the World\r\n\r\nBuilding a \"simple\" rollup has a ton of advantages:\r\n\r\n1. **Very scalable:** we build one chain, work with people like [Lito Coen](https://x.com/litocoen) to abstract the chain and facilitate the ease of access on general-purpose chains. Our entire team can focus on building one product (the chain), as opposed to having to build and maintain many different codebases and deployments.\r\n\r\n2. **Very flexible:** we can adapt the chain to our specific needs, continue the original research of v3 if we want to, and have full control over the end user experience given we control the whole stack.\r\n\r\n3. **We own the whole stack:** this is a regular meme of mine, controlling the stack is very powerful and is what inevitably any successful company tries to do. Google went from a search engine to a browser to an operating system to phones and computers. Facebook and Amazon both unsuccessfully tried to launch a smartphone. Facebook is now trying to capture AR/VR, the next hardware market.\r\n\r\n5. **Native and easy pricing:** as opposed to having to explain to users we charge x% on every stream created, or that we charge a $1 on every airstream claim, we can simply tell them the only fees are the gas fees on the network, like on a regular chain, and that our product itself is entirely free to use. On our end, we make money with the sequencer fees, which the stream creators would pay anyway if they were using another rollup. It's **THE** best pricing.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** [a simple rollup >>>>>>> multi-vm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/186a1c80-27f3-426a-9b05-2356ab57762f).\r\n\r\n## Design Mindset for a Simple Rollup\r\n\r\n**🚨 DON'T SKIP THIS PART, IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE 🚨**\r\n\r\n**First, a very important mindset we should adopt:** end users using our interface shouldn't know they are using a separate rollup. For them, it should feel like they are using a regular dApp.\r\n\r\nThey should feel confused when reading our documentation when learning that it's actually a chain in the backend. We have the advantage of having investors like [Lito Coen](https://x.com/litocoen), we should use these connections at our advantage.\r\n\r\nI initially trashed the multi-vm product experience, but we will still require supporting different wallet frameworks and custom VMs in our user interface, to handle deposits to the chain (when a user creates a stream), and withdrawals from the chain (when a recipient withdraws from a stream).\r\n\r\nOnce those deposits are made, we could just do confirmations via our interface (without even interacting with the wallets) sort of like how dYdX works, we could maybe even support in the long run sign-in via email or phone number and create a wallet in the backend for users, everything is in our control after all.\r\n\r\n**The point here is that we shouldn't, in my opinion, play the card of a regular general-purpose rollup which is to do a ton of business development to try to build an ecosystem etc. there are already 50 different rollups doing that. We should play the card of dYdX, which is to build a chain/rollup to make the end user experience even better and have full control over it.**\r\n\r\nThe Sablier rollup wouldn't be a general-purpose one in terms of optics, and that's perfectly fine. If others want to build on the chain, we will gladly help them and support them, but our main focus, like today, is our core product.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** [a simple rollup enables an incredible experience](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53a90052-341b-493a-83d0-0c16b42350f7).\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIt's actually based to [be against the multi-vm strategy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ba5348-4818-4877-af91-219cc3398e9b).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/everybody ","createdAt":"2024-07-17T09:36:48Z","labels":[],"number":63,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"The Moon Is Just Fine: The Case for a Simple Sablier Rollup","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-10-10T17:23:43Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/63"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"_This discussion originated in the [SabVM](https://github.com/sablier-labs/sabvm) repository, but it was moved here for privacy reasons._\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n[UCG](https://github.com/sablier-labs/sabvm/discussions/57) is a PITA.\r\n\r\n## TOGA\r\n\r\nTOGA = Transparent OnGoing Auction.

Ideally, we would set up some sort of a criteria which would, at least, scare away the bad actors.\r\n\r\n>As an extreme (?) example: we could charge, say, $100-1,000 for each Native Token minted on SabVM. This should be way more than enough to justify the cost of supporting the Token in the background for, like, several years into the future.\r\n\r\n>Maybe, we could even introduce a yearly subscription for supporting the Native Tokens💡\r\n\r\n@PaulRBerg:\r\n>If a user creates a junk NT that will never be used, that's OK. This is 100% equivalent to creating junk ERC20 on Ethereum, and it's related to the good old problem of state size growth. Check out the research done by the Ethereum folks on [state expiry](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/statelessness/), as well as this [post](https://forum.fuel.network/t/does-fuel-have-any-plans-for-state-rent/3030) I made in the Fuel forum.\r\n>Again, for the avoidance of doubt: state size growth is NOT the same problem as UCG (which is about the streaming graph).\r\n>If we charge for MNTs, nobody will use them. However, we could consider charging [state rent](https://solana.com/docs/intro/rent) at some point, but this is a monster topic and it deserves its own separate discussion.\r\n> It is impossible to ascertain who is and who isn't a bad actor. Governments have set up three-letter agencies to cope with this problem.\r\n\r\n@IaroslavMazur:\r\n>Unless we charge some exorbitant fees, people/projects willing to tap into our infrastructure of transferrable and streamable MNTs will be more than happy to pay the reasonable price. As it happens with any tool/service that is \"worth the price you pay\".\r\n\r\n>The main motivation here is to fight off a good chunk of the bad actors/spammers, and the idea is based on the [Hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash#:~:text=Hashcash%20is%20a%20cryptographic%20hash,proof%20can%20be%20verified%20efficiently.) system which Bitcoin has originally been inspired by.\r\n\r\n>Similar to how the PoW/PoS systems don't make assumptions about who's good and who's bad, but, instead, force everyone to behave (by wasting their resources if they don't), we could come up with a system that makes creating NTs economically unreasonable (i.e. a loss).\r\n\r\n>Charging an amount of SAB that is high enough to get rid of the low-level, dishonest actors, but low enough to remain appealing to the legit ones is one idea for such a system.\r\n\r\n@PaulRBerg :\r\n> No, they can't cause a lot of trouble just by creating NTs (as per the explanation given in the previous comment, that increasing state size is a cost we have to bear as a blockchain).\r\n> Charging a \"reasonable price\" in a blockchain environment is easier said than done because state rent is non-trivial.\r\n> I will concede that I was a bit blunt when I said that nobody will use NTs if we start charging for them. That's an open question\r\n\r\n@IaroslavMazur:\r\nThe attack vectors I've described above don't increase just the state size, but, also, the time that's required to process new txs. Therefore, this is a potential contributor to the UCG.\r\n\r\nJust to make sure my point is clear (apparently, I haven't properly ended my idea previously), I meant to say \"we could come up with a system that makes creating **ill-intentioned/spam** NTs economically unreasonable (i.e. a loss) **for the creator**.\"\r\n\r\nCharging something for creating NTs is one way of doing this: as any spam is only reasonable/profitable if it can be distributed extremely cheap/for free (the thing we'd eliminate).\r\n\r\n@PaulRBerg:\r\n>A one-time fee? isn't that simply setting a high gas cost for the MINT opcode?\r\n>State rent? This is very, very, very difficult and should be outside the scope of Genesis\r\n\r\n@IaroslavMazur:\r\nA one-time fee, in `SAB`, could be a solution - at least, temporary (until the state rent becomes feasible). And no, it's not the same as a high gas cost for `MINT`, because:\r\n1. the `SAB` fee could be changed dynamically, w/o requiring a hard fork (as changing the gas cost of the `MINT` opcode would)\r\n2. the `SAB` fee would be sent to the Sablier Treasury address - and not the block validator\r\n3. the `SAB` fee would positively impact the `SAB` price\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/sabvm ","createdAt":"2024-05-07T15:09:01Z","labels":[],"number":77,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Should anyone be allowed to create NTs (post-Genesis)?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-10-04T10:22:42Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/77"},{"author":"sneg55","body":"Ava Labs has initiated a usage-based grants program with a budget of $40 million.

Renaming `stream` to `lockup` though it might reflect a Status quo bias and can grow over time.\r\n\r\n### My views\r\n\r\nWhile I think point 3 can grow over time given his previous audit experience and familiarity with the `stream` keyword, I agree with him that the contract names could be confusing and less intuitive for external contributors. Prefixing names with `SablierV2` makes them longer and using `Lockup` in multiple names makes them less intuitive. \r\n\r\n### Relevant discussions from the past\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/discussions/255\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/discussions/222 (not a duplicate of above)\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/232\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 11 19 21\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/assets/6676622/d3fe3bc1-d0f8-4b41-a066-6f091d7b03f3\">\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 11 18 39\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/assets/6676622/c682b138-c6c9-46ca-9c48-fe21e7fae81b\">\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 11 18 27\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/assets/6676622/ac824ad2-d7cc-48d8-b200-1e65c38d3836\">","createdAt":"2024-04-28T10:48:22Z","labels":[],"number":51,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Rusty's feedback on the naming convention of contracts","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-09-04T20:13:34Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/51"},{"author":"IaroslavMazur","body":"Besides \"compacting\" the EVM `storage` variables (say, when declaring a struct in Solidity) simply by their byte size (i.e. declaring them in such a way/order that as few 32-byte `storage` slots as possible are used), it also makes sense (for some extra gas savings) to have the variables that are more likely to be used together in the same `storage` slot.\r\n\r\nIn this case, less gas will have to be paid for the `SLOAD`s of the respective `storage` variables, because there will, actually, be fewer `SLOAD`s performed.\r\n\r\nSo, when laying out the `storage` memory inside an EVM Smart Contract, a good strategy would be to:\r\n1. compact the `storage` variables, based on their size and, then,\r\n2. maximize the relative \"encapsulation\"/intra-relation of such compacted \"groups\" (e.g. if you have 2 `storage` slots occupied by an `address` and a `bool` each, make sure that, say, the `address` variable of the 1st slot is more likely to be accessed with the `bool` variable of the same slot - and not the `bool` variable from the other one)","createdAt":"2024-03-16T10:16:42Z","labels":[],"number":44,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Strategy for laying out `storage` variables inside Smart Contracts","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-09-04T17:23:01Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/44"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Do you have any thoughts on releasing the [Native Tokens fork of REVM](https://github.com/sablier-labs/sabvm/pull/14) separately from Sablier Mainnet?\r\n\r\nAs I see it, there would be two benefits:\r\n\r\n1.

As of today, merely three days after their launch, there is already ~50K USD in volume with ~300 NFTs listed on OpenSea, and the pricing seems quite efficient when you look at how close the NFTs are priced from one another. Worth noting that we aren't even in a bull market yet.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, it's fair to say, in my opinion, that we have evidence of early product/market-fit with this feature. Now, it's time to capitalize on that and go on the offense. The reason why this is so important is because the stream NFTs are the only way for us to build an actual strong moat with our protocol. If we are able to build up sufficient buy and sell liquidity on marketplaces like OpenSea for our NFTs, it will drive even more integrations (the ultimate moat) and become an argument for recipients to actually push the stream creators to use Sablier instead of a competitor (because of the higher liquidity it will be much easier for them to sell the stream if they want to). We should really make stream NFTs an asset that is fun and financially interesting to speculate on.\r\n\r\nHere are two ideas I think we should implement in the short run:\r\n\r\n- **Add a button in the interface for recipients** that have an incoming transferable uncancelable stream pushing them to sell it on OpenSea or another marketplace, we need to push people to list their NFT on there so there is sufficient liquidity on the sell side.\r\n- **Start using our personal capital, and the company's capital**, to buy uncancelable streams on OpenSea. This may be a little more controversial, but we should absolutely do this when it's for streams where the token is USDC, ETH, etc. meaning tokens that have proven value. We profit financially (we should obviously not buy streams where it doesn't make sense in terms of profitability), and we seed the buy liquidity in the market.\r\n- **Create a Dune dashboard to track** all of this activity (that's something I can do)\r\n- **Create educational content** (blog posts, a YouTube video, etc.) about buying/selling stream NFTs on a marketplace like OpenSea (again something I can do)\r\n\r\nI cannot stress enough the importance here, as this is our path to building a moat. This is the way we ultimately destroy the competition. This is the way we ultimately build up a strong ecosystem. Let the people speculate!

The protocol would remain free for most users, but it would bear a cost for highly active users (who transfer their NFTs).\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nI see two approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Charge on every transfer\r\n2. Add an allowlist and charge on every transfer to the said allowlist\r\n\r\nI don't know which is the best practice (or whether there is such a thing for NFT trading fees). I've asked around on X: [Are there any best practices for NFT trading fees](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1731754869654987108).\r\n\r\nBut anyway, both implementations would involve a change in the [`_beforeTokenTransfer`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/0f6c1417796ec71dcbd856a84b372affd7d5c749/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L379) hook.

There are several other monetization ideas that are more promising, such as [lending user deposits](https://github.com/sablier-labs/private-discussions/discussions/12).\r\n1.

The lack of a protocol fee switch removes any incentive on our end to push for those integrations. We should introduce one.\r\n\r\n## Flow Is Very Reliant on Integrations\r\n\r\nThe immediate core use cases for Flow are probably the following three: payroll, subscriptions and rent. For vesting, our existing Lockup protocol makes more sense.\r\n\r\nUse cases like payroll, like subscriptions, like rent, are very demanding on the compliance side. Employers want to be able to pay their employees easily while having no issues with their country's financial authorities, companies with a subscription service want to be fully compliant as well, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is not our business. Sablier is a tech company first and foremost. We build technology, not legal/compliance services. Flow will be heavily reliant on external integrations because of that. We will be dependent on the likes of [Toku](https://www.toku.com/), [TokenOps](https://tokenops.xyz/), etc. to integrate our protocol and offer the necessary tax/compliance tooling that users will require.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is that ultimately, the immense majority of Flow's usage will come from external integrations, as opposed to our own interface, simply because we cannot offer these compliance/tax services at scale.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** [we desperately need integrations.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1bbff54-71bb-42c2-9334-55da7cabe509)\r\n\r\n## Introducing a Fee Switch\r\n\r\nParadoxically, the inability for us to charge fees at the protocol level means we have no incentive to push for those integrations. Any integrator not redirecting users to our UI, so an integrator offering a deep integration, is effectively a competitor, as we have no monetization potential regarding their usage.\r\n\r\nArguments stating that integrations will result in increased TVL growth or NFT usage and hence help us even if the protocol is free to use, aren't valid. TVL is meaningless if we cannot monetize it, while NFT usage has been severally lacking in our Lockup protocol, and there is no indication it will fare better here.\r\n\r\nThe argument that we can always introduce a new version of the protocol later on with a fee switch if needed isn't valid either, as there is nothing preventing integrators from continuing to use the deprecated free version of the protocol.\r\n\r\nIt's in our best interest to introduce a fee switch, even if we only activate it in a few years, simply because that will give us the actual incentives to drive adoption for Flow. There is otherwise nothing to win in it for us.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** [we need a fee switch.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d764d5f-bd5e-4d8c-9916-7f55e4d4541d)\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIntroducing a fee switch for Flow (would also help for Lockup, but that's another discussion) [will solve all of the world's problems.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9d5145b-3110-43ac-8ac7-a964835918d9)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@sablier-labs/everybody ","createdAt":"2024-08-20T19:22:32Z","labels":[],"number":67,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Introducing a Flow Protocol Fee Switch","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-09-04T17:00:14Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/67"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Context\r\n\r\nYou can see more info on [Canny](https://sablier.canny.io/feature-requests/p/oraclized-streaming-rules).\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to implement this:\r\n\r\n## Closed-Ended (Cancel & Recreate)\r\n\r\nThis would work with V2 and a proxy setup.\r\n\r\n1.

But since it affects **all** integrators, it questions the reliability of hooks.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nFunctions like `withdraw`, `renounce`, and `cancel` can be executed without calling the hook if less gas is sent. This impacts external protocols relying on hooks to update states, affecting all integrators.\r\n\r\n## Preliminary ideas\r\n\r\nHere are some potential solutions, though none are universal:\r\n\r\n1. **Set a minimum gas limit** for hook calls, reverting if below the threshold. This minimum gas can be set by the sender or fixed in the `try..catch` block. Needs a new storage slot and increases minimum transaction cost.\r\n\r\n2. **Remove `try..catch` entirely**: and let the execution fail if the hook can't be called. This introduces the risk of DoS if a party has a malicious implementation.\r\n\r\n3. **Validate Return Data**: After the hook call is made, use a `require` statement to validate the return data. If the returned data is not as expected, the execution reverts. This guarantees that the hook call was fully executed. In case of less gas, the tx would revert because the hook wont return anything. In case of malicious party, the tx would revert because they need not necessary return the correct data.\r\n\r\n4. **Selective Hook Calls**: Remove `try..catch`, restrict calls to hooks based on function. This can limit incentive for exploitation. Senders have no incentive to exploit `cancel` and `renounce` whereas recipients have no incentive to exploit `withdraw`. \r\n    - `renounce` calls only to `ISablierV2Sender`\r\n    -  `withdraw` calls only to `ISablierV2Recipient`\r\n    - `cancel` calls only to `ISablierV2Sender`\r\n\r\nRFC cc @sablier-labs/engineers.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This issue affects all deployed versions as well as v2.2.","createdAt":"2024-06-17T08:01:45Z","labels":[],"number":60,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Questioning the reliability of hook calls","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-06-27T08:52:50Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/60"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Moonshot thinking: what if we enabled negative balances in SabVM with the explicit goal of creating a credit network?\r\n\r\nIn most likelihood, if we pursue this path, it should be done as a separate rollup (not the same rollup as the debit-based one).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"on-credit\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/assets/8782666/b171c98b-da7f-4d8e-a0a5-b4b68f7950cc\">\r\n","createdAt":"2024-05-31T10:30:05Z","labels":[],"number":58,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Allowing negative balances on SabVM to create a credit network","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-06-14T14:03:38Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/58"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"We've discussed this topic at various points in the past, but we've never reached a conclusive decision.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, building an EOES (EVM open-ended streaming) product would run counter to V3, since the former would solve the exact same problems solved by the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we would deceive ourselves if we didn't admit that EOES is a highly-requested feature.

Keep the protocol fees in the Core but remove the checks in the Periphery\r\n\r\n- Keep the standard protocol fees intact\r\n- Do not block airstreams when the fee is non-zero\r\n\r\n### 2.

And how should the OpenEnded implementation be versioned? Should it be part of V2.2 or V2.3? Why not V3? What should go in the [ASCII](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/761)? And if we build LockupLinear on Fuel or Solana, should we still include \"V2\" in the name of that contract?\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe easy bits:\r\n\r\n- The chain. We will just give it a bespoke name, isolating it from the rest of our products.\r\n- The npm package versions. As discussed [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/476), the only scalable approach is to start afresh every time a new package is deployed (i.e., start at `1.0.0` for `SablierV2LockupLinear`).\r\n    - Note that in the versioning system we are _currently_ using, there is a dichotomy between protocol releases and npm package versions. As pointed out by @andreivladbrg [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/762#discussioncomment-7919637), this can be confusing.\r\n\r\nThe hard bit: the smart contract names. There are three potential solutions:\r\n\r\n### 1. Package Tethering\r\n\r\nExamples: `SablierLockupLinear` and `SablierLockupDynamic`\r\n\r\n- There's only one version - the package version, e.g., V2 Core is [currently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sablier/v2-core) versioned as `1.1.2`\r\n- Remove all other versions from the contract names\r\n- Use the package version in the ASCII\r\n- In our external marketing, we stop referring to the protocol as \"Sablier V2\". Instead, we say \"Sablier's LockupLinear\", and so on.\r\n- All contracts deployed to all chains (including non-EVM ones) are called the same\r\n\r\n### 2. Product Tethering\r\n\r\nExamples: `SablierLockupLinearV2`, `SablierLockupDynamicV2`, `SablierLockupTranchedV1`, and `SablierOpenEndedV1`\r\n\r\n- Make the version a suffix\r\n- Tether the version to each product: LockupLinear, LockupDynamic, OpenEnded, etc.\r\n- Once the Lockup product range crosses a new threshold of complexity (e.g., voting and staking features), we swap V2 for V3\r\n- Assuming there is feature parity, an implementation of `LockupLinear` on Fuel would continue to have the version in its name\r\n- Sablier V1 becomes LockupLinearV1 (retroactively in our documentation)\r\n- The package versions continue to be developed in parallel\r\n\r\n### 3. Chain Tethering\r\n\r\nExamples: EVM: `SablierLockupLinearV2.2`, EVM: `SablierLockupLinearV3`, and Fuel: `SablierLockupLinearV1`.\r\n\r\n- A twist on the previous approach\r\n- The only difference is that a non-EVM implementation would not contain the same version as its EVM counterpart\r\n\r\n## My Thoughts\r\n\r\nMy vote goes to the first approach because it's by far the simplest and the most elegant. By adhering to a single versioning system, we:\r\n\r\n- Never mind the problem of how to distinguish between minor and major releases, i.e., when should a new implementation of EVM LockupLinear be called V3? Are voting and staking sufficiently big features that deserve a major version bump?\r\n- Solve the problem of cross-chain versioning. A Fuel/ Solana implementation of LockupLinear would be versioned afresh from `1.0.0`.\r\n- Get rid of the potential confusion between the protocol release and the package version\r\n\r\nThe only cost is on the copyright/ marketing front, where we would have to explain that what used to be called \"V2\" is now \"LockupLinear v1.x\". However, this is a reasonable price to pay in exchange for the above benefits. It is worth noting that, if we become a unicorn, the overwhelming majority of our future users are not using Sablier now. In the grand scheme of things, it won't matter what our historical product releases used to be called.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nCould you please vote and share your feedback, if any, @sablier-labs/everybody?\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/7\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/476\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/761\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/762","createdAt":"2023-12-31T17:50:37Z","labels":[],"number":25,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"How should contracts be versioned in the future?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-01-30T11:16:42Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/25"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the [`LockupTranched`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/private-discussions/discussions/19) contracts bring with it a problem:\r\n\r\nHow should we name the create functions?\r\n\r\nWe have a dilemma:\r\n\r\n1.

Give them different names\r\n\r\n## First Approach\r\n\r\nUsing the same names as in `LockupLinear` would run counter to the [principle of maximum separation](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1677610313993146368).\r\n\r\nThat is, in the big picture of Sablier V2, it would be confusing to have `LockupLinear` and `LockupTranched` use the `createWithDurations` and `createWithRange` terminology while `LockupDynamic` continues to use `createWithDeltas` and `createWithMilestones`.\r\n\r\nIf we go with this approach, I suggest renaming the create functions in `LockupDynamic`, too, so that we have a uniform API.\r\n\r\n## Second Approach\r\n\r\nThe problem with different names is that, well, I can't think of any good new names.\r\n\r\nMaybe `createWithTrancheDurations` and `createWithTrancheMilestones`?\r\n\r\nUsing just `createWithTranches` does not work because we would have to give up on the durations variant, but that's bad for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n## RFC\r\n\r\nI'm torn because I still stand by the logic laid out [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/327#discussioncomment-4981590).\r\n\r\nRFC from you, @sablier-labs/directors (especially @andreivladbrg and @razgraf).","createdAt":"2023-12-28T15:05:02Z","labels":[],"number":20,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"How to name the create functions in \"LockupTranches\"?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-01-22T12:01:42Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/20"},{"author":"maxdesalle","body":"This question arose in a Slack debate between @PaulRBerg and I regarding whether or not we should help and support TokenOps, an integrator of our protocol.\r\n\r\n## The Amazon strategy\r\nI stand by the fact that we should make UI integrations as accessible as possible and try to get as many competitors (because TokenOps is a competitor, I explain below why) to use our protocol, however, we should also aggressively pursue those market shares ourselves. These two views aren't mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nPlay the Amazon strategy: let others use your platform (sell products on Amazon), and if it works, create your own better and cheaper version of it and profit (which is basically the entire Amazon Basics product line). The only time we should actively help a platform integrating our protocol and not compete with them is if and only if their niche is so different from ours that we won't be able to create a competing offering.\r\n\r\nFor a more recent example, this is **EXACTLY** what OpenAI just did with their [developer conference announcements](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday). They let the past two years a ton of startups build on their API (= our protocol), saw what worked and what didn't, and then now released competing offerings in their own interface (upload images, read from PDFs, create custom GPTs, etc.). The difference being that OpenAI is in full control of its own API, it's a walled garden. We can't say the same about our protocol, it's in complete open access and we have no control over it. That's precisely why we should be even more aggressive when it comes to competition.\r\n\r\n## It's interfaces all the way down\r\nGiven we have no moat at the protocol level, we are really only competing at the interface level with others. There is a reason why Uniswap released Uniswap Wallet. Everyone is competing at the interface level. hedgey proves that users don't care about the underlying protocol (until they are hacked), they only care about the marketing and the user experience. TokenOps is a competitor. This is especially the case given we will likely eventually charge fees at the interface level, but it's much less likely that we will do so at the protocol level (explained below).\r\n\r\n## There is nothing to win in supporting TokenOps\r\n@PaulRBerg made the following comment to which I respond below:\r\n> Fabio showed me Hedgey's deck\r\n> Half of it were lies, but the other half were good business tactics\r\n> They are actively reaching out to teams in anticipation of them launching a token\r\n> They are basically \"holding their hands\" along the way\r\n> And NGL it's a good strategy that we will not have the bandwidth to execute on if we pursue V3\r\n> But TokenOps can do it!\r\n\r\nAnd how do we profit from that? We have zero equity in TokenOps, and given our protocol doesn't have a moat, if we introduce fees at the protocol it's inevitable that we will be outcompeted by another protocol (eventually), no matter how big of an engineering feat Sablier V2 is. There will then be nothing preventing TokenOps from migrating to that competitor, on the contrary, they will be incenvitized to given the lower fees. We are basically leaving a ton of money on the table by giving them free market shares, just for the sake of leaving a ton of money on the table.\r\n\r\n## TokenOps is easy to compete with (and we should have the bandwidth)\r\nIf we don't have the bandwidth, then we should hire people to do that. +80% of our team is engineering-focused right now, it's normal that we don't have the bandwidth. We shouldn't give free market shares to TokenOps, especially given how easy competing with them is. I mean, just look at their website, this is their \"security\" section, it's laughable, they took the most standard security practices and made it look extremely advanced with technical wording. They couldn't even spell \"MongoDB\" right.\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-11-14 at 12 57 22@2x](https://github.com/sablier-labs/private-discussions/assets/70470326/36d59565-efd3-4023-84ce-f5770803dd55)","createdAt":"2023-11-14T18:27:11Z","labels":[],"number":9,"repository":"sablier-labs/command-center","state":"closed","title":"Should we help integrators, or actively compete with them?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-01-23T17:53:59Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/9"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem\r\n\r\nOn top of adding opcodes like `CREATESTREAM` etc., the SabVM will also modify some of the existing EVM opcodes (mainly the `CALL` opcodes) to enable MNAs.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nTo provide a good developer experience for existing Solidity devs, we need a transpiler capable of two things:\r\n\r\n1.

It's a pretty cool experiment in incentive design, and the \"universal streaming engine\" meme is fairly accurate.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is worth pausing for a moment to reflect on the demand for Lockup Dynamic's functionality. Based on the comms that I had, the answer is a little. Lockup Linear is still da wei.\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions:\r\n\r\n1. Unlock in steps. The following companies/ devs have been fairly explicit that, for them, the unlock in steps is the most appealing feature of Lockup Dynamic:\r\n    - Pulley\r\n    - Utopia\r\n    - [Viraz Malhotra](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/690)\r\n2. Instant unlocks followed by linear streams. We have received [a few requests](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/581) for this.\r\n\r\nDid I miss anything? Please feel free to add your reflections below.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nOptimize for what users want and build a new flavor of Lockup (say, `LockupPeriodic` or `LockupSteps`) with the following properties:\r\n\r\n- Clear-cut periods and amounts; at the end of each period, the amount gets unlocked\r\n- No exponents\r\n\r\nThe benefits would be:\r\n\r\n1. Fits in perfectly with the traditional monthly vesting schemes (think real-world assets ported on-chain; they would still be bound to legal contracts). \r\n2. Better UX by removing exponents from the parameters users must provide + also letting users specify single periods rather than segments with N-1 and 1-second deltas.\r\n3. Gas efficiency.\r\n\r\nFWIW: Snapchat [implemented](https://help.pulley.com/en/articles/5048902-what-vesting-schedule-should-i-use-for-employees) a back-weighted vesting program. `LockupPeriodic` would have been a more straightforward solution for this use case than `LockupDynamic`.\r\n\r\n## Implications\r\n\r\nSuch a contract would not be a streaming solution anymore. We would need to consider rebranding as a \"payment provider\" or an \"infra provider\".\r\n\r\n## Mental Transaction Costs\r\n\r\nMy guess for why there is little interest in the non-discrete curves of Lockup Dynamic is that it adds mental transaction costs.

We've invested a significant amount of sweat into developing V2 Interfaces. These efforts deserve to be packaged in a publicly accessible front-end SDK to streamline the integration process for Sablier V2.\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nGenerally, what we want is for brokers to be able to install a `@sablier/v2-sdk` package that provides the necessary tooling for bootstrapping a Sablier-powered UI. The use cases are broker integrations, hackathon projects, etc.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nThis is what I think should be included in the SDK:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Contract types (re-exporting the output generated by `abitype`)\r\n- [ ] Subgraphs and GraphQL models\r\n- [ ] Streaming-related TypeScript types\r\n- [ ] Themes, as we want our branding to be present on as many websites as possible (\"Powered by Sablier\")\r\n- [ ] Calculation functions, e.g., for fees (these are not implemented now, but they could go in the `utils` packages)\r\n- [ ] Proxy management (the core logic would go in [PRBProxy](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy), but there may be some Sablier-specific features)\r\n- [ ] Storybooks\r\n- [ ] Some simple xState machines (maybe?)\r\n\r\nHowever, this is probably an incomplete list.

As outlined in the [official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview) there are quite a few strategies for data fetching between the server-generated files and their client counterparts.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-05 at 15 02 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15740806/222961949-1c52aea7-2073-4013-8eb7-56c90e589065.png)\r\n\r\n### Server side rendering (run time)\r\n\r\nThis is the most basic form and it makes use of the `getServerSideProps` utility.\r\n\r\n**How it works**\r\n\r\nThe server will perform some queries before rendering a static page and sending it to the client-side consumer. The client will then use that pre-fetched data and pre-rendered page and improve on it. From the [docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering):\r\n\r\n> On the client, the HTML is used to show a fast non-interactive page, while React uses the JSON data and JavaScript instructions to make components interactive (for example, attaching event handlers to a button). This process is called hydration.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Caveats**\r\n\r\nThe `getServerSideProps` utility will run in the following [scenarios](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props#when-does-getserversideprops-run):\r\n\r\n> - When you request this page directly, getServerSideProps runs at request time, and this page will be pre-rendered with the returned props\r\n> - When you request this page on client-side page transitions through [next/link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) or [next/router](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router), Next.js sends an API request to the server, which runs getServerSideProps\r\n\r\nWith the way the V2 app works, we'd like to request the server-side query **only** when the users visits the stream-profile page during a new session. If already in a client-session, it should rely on client-fetched data (e.g. own or searched streams) or perform a direct client-side request. This means we need to make sure `getServerSideProps` only runs on the first server call.\r\n\r\n### Static generation (build time)\r\n\r\nThis makes use of `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.\r\n\r\nThis strategy will pre-render pages at build time: meaning you have to anticipate most of the pages that should be pre-rendered. Unfortunately, for Sablier V2 we need (1) up-to-date data and (2) we expect thousands of streams getting created across multiple chains. This doesn't make SSG or ISR very attractive at the moment.\r\n\r\n📒 Read: [Next.js: Server-side Rendering vs. Static Generation](https://vercel.com/blog/nextjs-server-side-rendering-vs-static-generation#e-commerce-next.js-app-example)\r\n\r\n### Incremental re-generation (mix)\r\n\r\n📒 Read: [Netlify: Incremental Static Regeneration: Its Benefits and Its Flaws](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/03/08/incremental-static-regeneration-its-benefits-and-its-flaws/)\r\n\r\n> When you have a user come to your page, you want them to see the most up-to-date version, immediately. With ISR the first visitor to a page will not see that. They will always see a fallback first. And then later, if the data gets stale, the first visitor to see that cached page will see the out-of-date data first before it revalidates. Once again, this inconsistent experience can be pretty difficult to debug if your users experience negative side-effects as a result of old/unbuilt pages.\r\n","createdAt":"2023-03-05T13:06:51Z","labels":[],"number":198,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Walkthrough: SSR strategies","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-10-09T10:31:59Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/198"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"This is a private message that has informed us that Astaria will use Sablier to distribute their $STAR token:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"900\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e28b809-9d32-469b-bdd4-94d9db9a4c7a\"/>\r\n\r\nAs expected, there's some friction with collecting user addresses.

Ideally, the yield would be retained [for the sender](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/issues/643), but allowing the recipient to get the yield would be a good first step.\r\n\r\nTo enable this feature, we have to use [ERC-4626](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) vault tokens ([rebase tokens cannot be integrated into pooled contracts like Sablier](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1686457342106157060)).\r\n\r\nNow comes the problem: the recipient doesn't want some fancy [vault token](https://erc4626.info/vaults/) in their wallet.

A bespoke unwrap functionality that opens a modal after the user withdraws tokens from a vault stream. This functionality could also be added to \"Account settings\".\r\n2. Write a bespoke contract that handles the unwrapping part, and have the user approve this bespoke contract as an NFT operator that can call `withdraw` on their behalf.

By using the terms \"streams\" and \"airstreams\", we're fighting an uphill battle. Users and LLMs will be confused.\r\n\r\nTBH, I have never been satisfied by the introduction of the \"Streams/ Airstreams\" dichotomy in the navigation bar. The category structure seems to be off because Airstreams are built on top of Streams.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n- Re-organize our navigation bar by:\r\n    - Removing \"Streams\" and \"Airstreams\"\r\n    - Introducing new categories: \"Vesting\", \"Drops\", and \"Payroll\"\r\n    - In the future, introduce a \"Marketplace\" category (ref [here]())\r\n- At the beginning, \"Payroll\" would be completely equivalent to the \"Vesting\" UI, except maybe for the cliffed shapes, which can be disregarded here.\r\n- In the future, when we roll out the OpenEnded smart contract system, the Payroll view would be enhanced by the open-ended functionality\r\n- Maintain backward-compatibility via redirects, e.g., from `app.sablier.com/airstreams` to `app.sablier.com/drops`\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- It is worth noting that our competitors are already implementing something like what I'm suggesting here (ref [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/3))\r\n- We can still refer to \"Drops\" as \"Airstreams\" in the copyright.\r\n\r\n## Consequences and Analysis\r\n\r\nAccepting this proposal would address multiple problems in one fell swoop:\r\n\r\n- Terminological clarity (\"vesting\" instead of \"streams\") - users think in terms of concrete use cases, not abstract engineering categories\r\n    - We can talk about money streaming on Wikipedia and in our whitepapers and other academic-ish work\r\n- Prepare the UI for the inevitability of the [OpenEnded](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-open-ended) product\r\n- Improve our SEO\r\n\r\nThe only downside I can think is a potential \"pigeonhole\" effect. There might be users who are using Sablier for non-vesting, non-airdrop, and non-payroll use cases. By using concrete use cases instead of abstract categories, these users may worry that Sablier is no longer a good fit for them. However, this user base should be a small contingent - otherwise, we would have heard about them.\r\n\r\n## RFC\r\n\r\nCc @sablier-labs/everybody.\r\n\r\nThe key question to answer is: **do we really care more about memetic pageantry than user growth** (as a result of good SEO, easy memetic comprehensibility, etc.)?\r\n\r\nI should hope that we do not.\r\n\r\nNote that this discussion touches upon the issues debated in all the following discussions:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/32\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/discussions/601\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/34\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/708\r\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/3","createdAt":"2024-02-09T13:44:12Z","labels":["type: feature"],"number":880,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Use-case centric navigation UI/UX","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-09-10T13:23:43Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/880"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"*This suggestion was originally made by @IaroslavMazur on July 19, 2023 on [Canny](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/780).

Unfortunately, as of today, Tenderly doesn't offer an indexer tool for their Sandbox.\r\n\r\nThat said, this could be a nice feature for our lite app. I'm starting this discussion to track and revisit this idea in the future.\r\n\r\n| 1 | 2 |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| <img width=\"285\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-06 at 14 08 38\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2fd7ef0-ab91-49f7-a1fa-34873eaa3c12\"> | <img width=\"235\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-06 at 14 08 42\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/557471ab-3676-42cc-8907-7a8056dbc809\"> |","createdAt":"2024-08-06T08:41:23Z","labels":[],"number":1041,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Sandbox Mode for Sablier App Preview","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-08-06T08:41:23Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1041"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"It would be helpful if the default templates (specifically, `airstream-template` and `linear-duration-template`) contained additional sheets that showed the CSV format with ranges instead of durations.\r\n\r\nWhile it's possible that having multiple sheets would make the CSV file not loadable in the Sablier UI, I still think it would be good to do this - it would make users consciously aware of the existence of the range option for timing.\r\n\r\nOr maybe, alternatively, we could add a link to our [documentation site](https://docs.sablier.com/apps/guides/csv-support) somewhere in the spreadsheet?\r\n\r\nRFC @sablier-labs/frontend.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"SCR-20240802-lcqd\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b284e48d-50bd-454c-8277-bd9e02ac83f9\">","createdAt":"2024-08-02T09:26:39Z","labels":[],"number":1030,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Add multiple sheets in the default templates to educate users about the different timing options","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-08-04T11:17:28Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1030"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"This label possibly creates confusion:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"350\" alt=\"SCR-20240802-mbnt\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f70024b-f6ff-4e76-8d03-cc2a3a07de53\">\r\n\r\nIt should be added only when the number of streams >= 2\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/frontend","createdAt":"2024-08-02T10:31:33Z","labels":[],"number":1034,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Hide \"Group of 1\" for single streams","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-08-02T14:52:14Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1034"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Requested by a potential Airstream user (SmartShift):\r\n\r\n| 1 | 2 | \r\n| - | - |\r\n| <img width=\"873\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 14 38 45\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3b6ef80-eaa5-4934-aa74-7f6c0ced7dbe\"> | <img width=\"891\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 14 38 38\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5b1e7a8-7b03-405a-af95-ea792c7eebd0\"> | ","createdAt":"2024-07-23T14:24:38Z","labels":[],"number":1025,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"VPN protection in Airstreams geoblocking","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-07-23T14:24:38Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1025"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"As reported by this chap via email, CC @sablier-labs/frontend:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"SCR-20240715-marv\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da672a3-c542-44be-a4b6-5db60fe0521c\"> \r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"SCR-20240715-maqu\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a28b2869-8493-4df4-9123-8d1966bc1b34\">\r\n","createdAt":"2024-07-15T10:29:10Z","labels":[],"number":1013,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Should we do anything about the Referrer-Policy Header and the Content-Security-Policy?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-07-15T17:57:52Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1013"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"The monthly shape is structured to have its first unlock one month after the start date. \r\nA user has asked for the initial unlock to happen right when the stream starts.\r\n\r\nTwo questions to consider addressing here:\r\n1.

I have now opened this discussion to compare the pros and cons of integrating Ronin into the V2 app.\r\n\r\n## Comparison\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n1. Business partnership with a significant market player\r\n2. Good marketing on Twitter\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n1. Distraction from other much more important tasks:\r\n    - Growing and promoting V2 itself\r\n    - Airstreams\r\n    - V3\r\n2. Large risk of investing effort into something that may not yield much ROI; given Ronin's TVL in Sablier V1, how many users of `SablierV2LockupPro` do we realistically expect to have on Ronin?\r\n3. Non-negligible development cost; supporting Ronin is different from supporting a typical EVM chain because they don't have ready-to-use integrations in popular web3 frameworks, their chain is permissioned, etc.\r\n    - We have to deploy PRBProxy on their chain, too\r\n    - Plus Multicall3 (as discussed [here](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-periphery/discussions/13#discussioncomment-5219760))\r\n4. Huge time waster maintenance-wise (Ronin's JSON-RPC servers are often down)\r\n\r\n## My Take\r\n\r\nIn light of the comparison above (especially the first point, which is critical), it appears that supporting Ronin in the V2 UIs is not a worthwhile investment. Ronin's needs may be sufficiently met with Sablier V1, and there are numerous other avenues for Twitter marketing. I'd much rather have @razgraf and @gavriliumircea brainstorm on the product front for V3 than work on an integration that'd get us $14k extra EVM TVL.\r\n\r\nMore generally speaking, we've grown to a point where we must allocate our time carefully. There are many potential areas for improvement that could benefit Sablier, but we must identify those that will yield the most sustainable growth in the long term.","createdAt":"2023-03-06T22:06:39Z","labels":[],"number":200,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"To Ronin or not to Ronin","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-05-13T11:42:57Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/200"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Adding support for testnets like this is overkill in the production app because 99.99% of all Sablier users don't want to see these networks.\r\n\r\nWhat if we created a new staging environment in Vercel for use cases like this, i.e. add support for testnets?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"SCR-20240503-mzou\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/8782666/be18c857-312b-4adf-877e-70a01ac2a519\">\r\n","createdAt":"2024-05-03T13:39:55Z","labels":[],"number":946,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"New staging environment on Vercel for testnet deployments","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-05-06T15:31:59Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/946"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"UTC is a standard, and so it should lead less to more deterministic outcomes.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/sablier-labs/docs/issues/141\r\n\r\ncc @sablier-labs/frontend ","createdAt":"2024-04-18T12:28:25Z","labels":[],"number":932,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Use UTC instead of local time in CSV upload","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-04-18T12:31:33Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/932"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"The idea is to create a lite version of the client app that:\r\n1. is fully open-source\r\n2. relies only on on-chain data (as much as possible)\r\n3. uses the user's RPC and doesn't re-route through Sablier's channels\r\n4. deployed on IPFS\r\n\r\nNote: we already have a starting point with the v2-sandbox, although that repository should remain separate from the lite app as it will contain: sample code/snippets, subgraph usage, not optimized for decentralization or dependency reduction","createdAt":"2024-04-16T13:27:56Z","labels":[],"number":928,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Create a \"lite\" fully decentralized version of the app","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-04-16T14:17:40Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/928"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"It's great that we [added caveats](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/575#issuecomment-1790664110) about the slow indexing times, but I've gotten fed up with The Graph.

As a first time user, I have a couple of feedbacks. \r\n\r\nIdentifying streams can be challenging in case of multiple streams\r\n------------\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nOn the `All Streams` screen, it could be challenging for a user to identify the nature of the streams. Its not a problem when you have a small number of streams but imagine someone having 20-30 streams a year (not sure if we have seen that yet).\r\n\r\n**Possible solution**\r\n\r\nThere could be an option to `label/tag` them manually and then display them under the _Status_ column on each stream. Ex. _vesting_, _airdrop_, _payment_ etc. Users may have various reasons to label them. One such could be to use this information during taxes. \r\n\r\nMissing Close btn in _choose date and time_ frame.\r\n------------\r\nEven though clicking on _Clear_ btn closes it, it also clears the selected datetime value.\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 11 55 58\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/6676622/9159d447-32b9-4aa4-b1c5-dff4428c7f28\">\r\n\r\nBlurry token icon in case of USDC\r\n------------\r\nI checked other streams [(clear image)](https://app.sablier.com/stream/LL-42161-200/).

Showing the full value as a tooltip when I hover over it could be helpful.\r\n\r\n2. **Stream screen**: Not sure if _Created on_ is more useful information than _Started On_, my thought is that showing _Started on_ instead of _Created on_ in the _Attributes_ section could be beneficial.

Collaborating with other people on a git repository is a completely different experience to working alone. In a team, branching and merging code can become messy fast.\r\n\r\nAs per this [article](https://www.flagship.io/git-branching-strategies/) (which I have read in full and is a good read on the topic), there are basically four well-known git branching strategies:\r\n\r\n1. GitFlow\r\n2. GItHub Flow\r\n3. GitLab Flow\r\n4. Trunk-based Development\r\n\r\n## Comparing the Strategies\r\n\r\nWe can discard the third strategy (GitLab) from the get-go, because we're hosting our repo on GitHub and the target audience seems to be iOS app development.\r\n\r\n### GitFlow\r\n\r\n- Maintain a bunch of long-running branches in parallel\r\n    - Master\r\n    - Develop\r\n    - Long-lived feature branches\r\n    - Release branches\r\n - Merge whenever the features or the releases are finished\r\n - No pressure on committing quickly\r\n\r\n### GitHub Flow\r\n\r\n- Simpler alternative to GitFlow\r\n- Apart from lack of release branches, identical with GitFlow\r\n\r\n### Trunk-based Development\r\n\r\nFurther reading about TBD on https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com.\r\n\r\n- No multiple long-running branches in parallel. Just one.\r\n- No release branches or long-lived feature branches.\r\n- Commit frequently (at least once in 24 hours) and ideally on `main` directly, when a PR wouldn't be useful for historical purposes.\r\n- Keep feature branches small and make PRs for them frequently (at least once in 3 days)\r\n\r\n## My Proposal\r\n\r\nThere is no need to have hard-and-fast rules. However, we should welcome heuristics, as they are better than no strategy at all. This is the heuristic that I propose regarding our branching strategy.\r\n\r\n- When we know that nobody else is working on something else at the same time, each one of us uses whatever grinds his gears\r\n- When we know that at least one other person is working on something else at the same time, we use TBD\r\n\r\nMy money is on TBD for collaboration because it's the one that best minimizes git conflicts and it's a key enabler of Continuous Integration.\r\n\r\nFWIW, this is also what the article recommends doing in our circumstance. That is, when the team is small and the collaboration \"maturity\" (I.e. how knowledgeable and experienced the contributors are with git) is high, TBD is the only recommended strategy:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-17 at 11 24 13 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8782666/196276144-e312195f-e1f2-42d6-92e8-2f0b4afa0977.png\">\r\n\r\n### Clarifications\r\n\r\n1. TBD itself doesn't say anything about frequency of PR reviews. Of course, ideally the reviews would be made quickly, but there is no pressure on doing that, since another branch can be created from the previous PR's branch.\r\n2. TBD also doesn't say anything about whether a PR review is needed at all. Given where we stand right now (i.e. a period of very active development), we can gloss over PR reviews e.g. when implementing new pages and components.\r\n\r\n## Note on Experimentation\r\n\r\nTo me, TBD looks by far the most promising (also see arguments left in https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-interfaces/discussions/30). Of course, this is only a guess, and I need help from you in order to test my hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe catch is that unlike software libraries that can be tested alone, it is not possible to test a branching/merging strategy without getting outside of our comfort zone and experimenting with it for a while as a team (I suggest a month at a minimum).","createdAt":"2022-10-17T20:37:41Z","labels":[],"number":55,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"A comparison of git branching strategies","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-01-09T15:54:18Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/55"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Requested by 5ire:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"SCR-20231229-nufn\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/8782666/2989a167-e207-4024-95ec-3cf73bb776d6\">\r\n\r\nNot sure how we could implement this.

I've opened this discussion just so we are aware of this possibility.","createdAt":"2023-06-02T12:23:25Z","labels":[],"number":284,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Feature request: module for withdrawing assets from the proxy","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2024-01-05T11:50:43Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/284"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Relaying the question I asked @gavriliumircea [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/442#discussioncomment-5937501):\r\n\r\nAs shown by [this fuzzing function](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/5997ac05751960259c03aa166158d5db8aea1675/test/utils/Fuzzers.sol#L99-L116), the deposit amount calculations get complicated quite quickly once fees are thrown into the equations.\r\n\r\nAre the broker and the protocol fee hard-coded to zero in the front-end calculations?

Our streams may suffer from the same issue.\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\nStreams will live and be identified by\r\n- the chain they were created on (e.g. 1 \"eth\", 137 \"matic\" or 42161 \"arbitrum\")\r\n- the type of contract they were created by (e.g. \"linear\" or \"pro\" ... or later \"pro 2\", \"pro 3\")\r\n- the contract they were created by (e.g. \"0xabc12\" or \"0xde456\" - e.g. there may be multiple deployments of \"linear\" we accept)\r\n- the unique streamId/tokenId given by the contract from the step above\r\n\r\nHow do we create a stream identifier to be used by our application, while maintaining good UX as well as practicality.\r\n\r\n## Option 1: A global chain specific identifier - the `globalId`\r\n\r\nA simple, unique, numeric identifier would be perfect from a visual standpoint. It would follow on the footsteps of our v1 app. It would also make it easy for the user to share their stream id with others (or with us for debugging).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhttps://app.sablier.finance/stream/137-100\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can extract the `chainId` and the `globalId` from this URL and showcase the stream inside the app.\r\n\r\n- Simple, easy to remember\r\n- Doesn't clutter the UI\r\n- We need a short ID anyway to make it easy for the user to identify the stream\r\n\r\n### Biggest Downsides\r\n\r\n#### Subgraph redundancy\r\n\r\nIn case our subgraph stops working, we may want to redirect the user to `light.sablier.finance` (name is a WIP), our web3-only portal. This way, they would still be able to interact with the stream.\r\nThe problem? `100` (as in the example above) was an id fully generated by the subgraph, it doesn't exist in the contracts. If this one doesn't work, we have no way of resolving the stream using it.\r\n\r\nNote: If we want our app to be truly multi-chain, we can't really get rid of the chainId, although doing it would simplify the URL even more.\r\n\r\n## Option 2: A complex, fully independent identifier - the `globalPath`\r\n\r\nA longer path provides worse UX for the user but better long term support.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhttps://app.sablier.finance/stream/0xabcd...41c-137-100 // contract address shortened for brevity\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can extract the `contract`, `chainId` and the `streamId` from this URL and showcase the stream inside the app.\r\n\r\n- Includes all the important information to resolve the stream even without the subgraph\r\n- The app link can be instantly replaced with the light app and the stream would resolve (even with contracts we don't support - good for testing)\r\n- It's 100% unique, even on contract address collision (same on multiple networks)\r\n\r\n### Biggest Downside\r\n\r\n#### Visual aspect\r\n\r\nIt is ugly and hard to remember. \r\nSome parts of our app still require a simple, easy to remember ID users can share amongst themselves (see Stream Profile for example). Therefore, we may have to use both, the `globalPath` for the URL and the `globalId` for visuals.\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2022-12-28T15:01:48Z","labels":[],"number":143,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Unique stream identifiers","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T14:50:02Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/143"},{"author":"IaroslavMazur","body":"![image](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/22785348/09f978a2-06bb-4f69-9139-8a454dfdc953)\r\n\r\n@razgraf, @maxdesalle \r\n\r\nHere are several suggestions for enhancing the message shown to the users in the **Pricing** section, introduced in #666 :\r\n\r\n- It feels like \"it will remain\" was intended to be the beginning of a new sentence.\r\n\r\n- \"There are no active fees\" sounds a) redundant (given that the first sentence communicates the same idea) and, by extension, b) fishy (like, when politicians repeat the same idea over and over, making it \"true\" in the process😅).

The journey of a user who has never interacted with Sablier involves _four_ transactions:\r\n\r\n1. Deploy PRBProxy\r\n2. Approve Permit2\r\n3. Sign Permit2\r\n4. Create stream\r\n\r\nThe UX is even worse for DAOs, who may have to vote on each particular transaction (see [this](https://sablier.slack.com/archives/CT3NXSNMS/p1691677673729299)).\r\n\r\nThe goal is to lower the number of transactions to _three_, although _two_ would be ideal.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis is a hairy problem for which the solution is complex. Here's how I suggest tackling it:\r\n\r\n1. Get rid of Permit2 and switch to [standard ERC-20 approvals](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/pull/161). More specifically, implement a toggle and default to standard ERC-20 approvals.\r\n2. Detect if the user is a Safe multisig and, if yes, do not deploy a PRBProxy and use the newly introduced [`SablierV2Batch`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/pull/177) instead.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n1. Not using PRBProxy will lose all of the benefits discussed in https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/discussions/11. However, it should be possible to install our proxy target as a Safe module and use it in important scenarios like bug fixes and migration between releases.\r\n2.

However, the wording can be slimmed down.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nMaking the proxy explicit and referencing it everywhere is problematic:\r\n\r\n1. First and foremost: it adds cognitive load onto non-technical users. Rather than focusing on educating these users on the nature of lockup streaming (which is a difficult thing to do, anyway!), we are also giving them homework on proxies. And this is a tall ask - I know Solidity developers who grapple with the forwarding proxy design.\r\n2. Stuffing the app with proxy references makes it more difficult to use and understand:\r\n     - When searching streams, how are users supposed to find the proxy address of a particular EOA? Go to Etherscan and call `getProxy`? People know about EOAs, not proxies.\r\n     - When recipients open the app, they see an alien address streaming tokens to them instead of the typical address they thought their payer had\r\n3.  The term \"proxy\" refers to different technical designs in Ethereum, and people dunk on most of them [^1]\r\n    - Unfortunately for us, the \"upgradeable proxy\" is the most popular type of proxy, which means that some Sablier users (many?) may be misled into considering Sablier an upgradeable protocol\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. In the subgraph, normalize the streams so that proxy-originating streams are added to the EOA's list of streams\r\n    - Add an ancillary property for tracking the proxy that created the stream, which is null when the sender creates streams directly\r\n    - Optionally, add a boolean `rawSender`\r\n2. In general: display only EOAs regardless of whether the raw sender (in V2 Core) is the EOA's proxy\r\n3. In the search view: allow search by EOA only.\r\n4. For every sender action, check the raw sender;\r\n    - If `sender == proxy`: call V2 Periphery via proxy\r\n    - If `sender != proxy`: call V2 Core directly\r\n5. Keep mentioning the proxy in the wallet modal (but not the wallet button), as well as in various informational tooltips.\r\n\r\n## Concluding Remarks\r\n\r\nThere will be challenges in any case, but abstracting away the proxy may come with fewer downsides compared to making it glaringly explicit.\r\n\r\nBesides the refactoring cost, the only challenge introduced by my suggested solution would be one of *reverse synchronization* with the crypto ecosystem. People may look on Etherscan, see the raw sender (i.e., the proxy), open the Sablier UI, and try to search by that proxy address assuming that it is a direct user.\r\n\r\nHowever: (i) these are read-only users, and (ii) these are external users, and (iii) reverse lookups should be rare.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://twitter.com/optimizoor/status/1671648226439741442","createdAt":"2023-06-25T20:57:07Z","labels":[],"number":470,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Abstracting away the proxy is possible","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-08-21T12:49:55Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/470"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Feature\r\n\r\nMultiple roads lead to this conclusion: that it would be a valuable feature for the stream creation form to be able to parse URL parameters, e.g.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhttps://app.sablier.com/create/single/?shape=linear&amount=1000&startTime= 1691498438...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe amount parameter would be filled in the amount input, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\n1.

The quintessential attribute of V2.0 streams isn't that they are \"linear\" or \"dynamic\"; it's that they are lockup streams.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't pose a problem in the short term, since lockup is our only streaming model. But as soon as we ship another model, the URLs will confuse and mislead everybody - especially if that future streaming model can also be differentiable along the lines of \"linear\" and \"dynamic\".\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is thus to refactor the identifiers to include the \"lockup-\" prefix before \"linear\", like this:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n/stream/lockup-linear-ChainId-StreamId\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing so would not just prevent the aforementioned long-term issue; there would be more benefits:\r\n\r\n1.

issue](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/294) about the Lodash mixins has made me realize an implicit design choice in the `types` package that I do not find helpful. Namely, both module declarations (for external libraries) and custom types (defined in our repo alone) are bundled under the same umbrella \"types\".\r\n\r\nThe issue is three-fold:\r\n\r\n1. Those two entities are rather different (in a qualitative way), since the custom types can be instantiated as objects, whereas the library extensions cannot.\r\n2. It is easy to miss the link between the modules defined in `packages/types` and the actual place where the extensions are defined. I mean, how is a developer (a non-author) supposed to figure this out? Search for the function names and try to infer which module goes with which definition? Module declarations should live as closely as possible to the place where the logic is defined.\r\n3. This design makes it difficult (or even impossible) to switch to a per-package compilation pipeline (ref https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/290).\r\n","createdAt":"2023-06-03T14:23:54Z","labels":[],"number":296,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Suggestion to move the module declarations next to where they are defined","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-06-17T12:14:56Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/296"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"In https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/pull/342, I suggested the introduction of a new package `@sablier/extension`, which would store extensions of external libraries like Lodash to provide type safety and encapsulation. However, I also said that introducing this package might be overkill given that there's only Lodash to be mindful of.\r\n\r\nBut then @razgraf's [made](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/pull/342#discussion_r1224377806) this good point:\r\n\r\n> Note for when packages will be used as independent libraries\r\n>\r\n> In absence of this initializer (no end app), the developer should keep in mind that any configurations for BigNumber will have to be mentioned separately.\r\n\r\nThis makes an even stronger case for the `@sablier/extensions` package, as we could put `BigNumber` in there, and we could also include `dayjs` given that we have to extend [certain plugins](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/blob/main/packages/utils/src/libraries/lodash.ts). The API would turn into this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { BigNumber } from \"@sablier/extensions\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #326, I grant that importing from `bignumber.js` is clearer — no question about that. But I think we should prioritize type safety, since having to remember things in a large code base like V2 Interfaces is error-prone. This is why I opened PR #342 in the first place - to encapsulate the Lodash mixins (and their types) so that the developer doesn't have to think about them.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could just put the `BigNumber` extension in `@sablier/utils`. I don't mind either way as long as we encapsulate the initialization step.\r\n\r\n_Side note_: this proposal is actually independent of #290, i.e., it would improve the baseline developer experience with or without a monorepo.

I'm simply trying to bring V2 Interfaces to a _baseline_ of what monorepos typically mean in software engineering. It is not a matter of making the packages publishable (although, as you shall see below, we should do this); the current structure is intrinsically incorrect.\r\n\r\nPer all the reasons I have given [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/290#issuecomment-1575012548) and [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/290#issuecomment-1576555172), V2 Interfaces is currently just a repo with a complicated directory structure. Yarn Workspaces is a glorified path aliasing system (TypeScript's [`paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/paths.html) would have sufficed) and all `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`  files under `packages` can be discarded and, with a minimal refactor, the apps would continue to work.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you go look at the research materials shared in https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/discussions/332, you will see that no publicly shared monorepo template resembles V2 Interfaces, i.e., nobody compiles everything with the `**/*.ts` glob placed in the root TSConfig file.\r\n\r\nThe closes match is [this design](https://turbo.build/blog/you-might-not-need-typescript-project-references) by Turborepo, but even this is quite different from V2 Interfaces. They don't put the `**/*.ts` glob at the root, and they use a trick with the `types` field in `package.json`, which is not present in V2 Interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Type Errors\r\n\r\nA critical benefit of a well-separated package structure is sensitivity to type errors.\r\n\r\nMany type errors have reared their head only after switching to a monorepo, e.g., https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/311. However, there have been many other errors for which I did not open GitHub issues, per the agreement with @gavriliumircea that issues should be exclusively about the `main` branch.\r\n\r\nThese errors flew under the radar because the packages were not compiled individually, and important compiler settings like `declaration` and `declarationMap` were not enabled.\r\n\r\n### Front-end SDK\r\n\r\nI initially considered this desideratum a comparatively minor point, but now I believe package publishability in V2 Interfaces is critical to growing Sablier V2.\r\n\r\nAs @maxdesalle's early integration efforts have shown us, our [broker fee model](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/145) is getting good validation.\r\n\r\nTo enable a seamless integration experience for third-party brokers, it would be wise to provide them with an open-source front-end SDK, which would be composed of the packages in V2 Interfaces (for obvious reasons, e.g., to avoid code duplication). Off the top of my head, this is what I think we should equip integrators with:\r\n\r\n- Contract types (re-exporting the output generated by `abitype`)\r\n- Subgraphs and GraphQL models\r\n- Streaming-related TypeScript types\r\n- Calculation functions, e.g., for fees (these would go in the `utils` packages)\r\n- Themes, as we want our logo to be present on as many websites as possible (\"Powered by Sablier\")\r\n- Proxy management functions (though the core logic should go in [PRBProxy](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy), there may be some Sablier-specific features)\r\n- Storybooks (ref https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/discussions/3)\r\n- Some simple xState machines (maybe?)\r\n\r\nWe should refine this idea in a separate discussion later on. The point, for now, is that the ability to publish some parts of the monorepo to the npm registry is important for Sablier as a business.\r\n \r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe challenge in turning V2 Interfaces into a TypeScript monorepo lies in implementing all currently-unachieved desiderata while not degrading the current developer experience (e.g., hot reloading).\r\n\r\nAnd it turns out it is possible to do that - see my PR in #383.","createdAt":"2023-06-12T14:28:09Z","labels":[],"number":382,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"[*] Walkthrough: Monorepofication","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-06-16T21:12:04Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/382"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Context\r\n\r\nBuilding TypeScript monorepo with Next.js apps is _hard_.

I researched only the most promising ones.\r\n\r\n### 1. Redux\r\nThe obvious old-school choice is React-Redux. While it benefits from a ton of tooling and libraries (such as React Saga, React Persist, the Thunk architecture) it's also very heavy to set up and use. Doesn't make a lot of sense for a small to medium sized application.\r\n\r\n### 2. [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) / [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/docs/basic-tutorial/atoms)\r\nJotai is built upon the same architecture as Recoil. As these are pretty similar (people argue Jotai is more lightweight) I'm not going to cover Recoil.\r\n\r\n### 3. [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)\r\nThis seems to be the most popular approach by npm trends.\r\n\r\nGood [comparison](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/comparison) article from Zustand.\r\n\r\n🧠 [Uniswap](https://github.dev/Uniswap/interface) is a good example of a project using both Zustand and Jotai.\r\n\r\n### 4. [Valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio)\r\nResearch pending.\r\n\r\n### 5. [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/overview) (state manager for server state)\r\n\r\nFor server requests one should use React Query. Used alongside Fetch API, it provides tools such as caching and query optimizations right from the start. More on this specifically in #31.\r\n\r\n\r\nResources: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-1LM2NySR0) - this was extremely helpful 🧠, [article](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/practical-react-query)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, using Context API and implementing our own data stores using localStorage and cookies is redundant at this point as we'd just reinvent the wheel.

Data storage\r\n\r\nFetching data will be achieved using `react-query` and more specifically `react-apollo`. We rely on the subgraph to provide us with the necessary intel. We identify the following high-level queries:\r\n\r\n### Public queries\r\nQueries that aren't linked to a connected user. These may as well be triggered during the disconnected state of the app using our own infrastructure (public provider, etc.) over all the data available.\r\n\r\n#### a. streams[] \r\nFetch streams through a public provider. These will be **filtered** \r\n - by chain (user can pick which chain to search on)\r\n - by IDs\r\n - by sender / recipient\r\n\r\n#### b. searches[]\r\nThis will help store the lists of streams (_or other type of results ?_) coming from a specific search.\r\n\r\n> ‼️ The filtering step will be preceded by a search step. We also need a way to store these potential search results.\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface Search{\r\n  filter: {\r\n   chain: string;\r\n   ids: string[];\r\n   sender: string;\r\n   recipient: string;\r\n }\r\n streams: []\r\n groups: [] // We might drop this feature ?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n> 📔  This preempts a stored **current filter / search**.\r\n\r\n#### c. stream → streams[].push()\r\nFetch stream through a public provider. This will be identified through the route (URL configuration):\r\n- by chain, contract and tokenId\r\n\r\n#### d. history\r\nEach stream will also have a history - a list of actions taken in the context of that stream (create, transfers, withdrawals etc.). This will be a \"lazy query\" enabled only upon access of the stream profile's history modal.\r\n\r\n### Private queries (self)\r\nQueries that are linked to the connected user. Some of these replicate the public queries.\r\n\r\n#### a. streams[]\r\nFetch streams created by the user on the chosen chain. Mirrors the **public** behavior.\r\n\r\n#### b. searches[]\r\nFetch filtered/searched streams. Mirrors the **public** behavior.\r\n\r\n#### c. stream → streams[].push()\r\nFetch a specific stream. Mirrors the **public** behavior. Does enable some extra permissions if the current user is either a sender or a recipient.\r\n\r\n#### d. history\r\nLazy fetch a stream's history. Mirrors the **public** behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the public behavior is pretty much the same as the private one. Therefore, we should engineer this one first.\r\n\r\n### Specific queries\r\nAlthough mixed in the description above, we can separate the following queries from the way their results get stored:\r\n - get filtered streams (by id, by sender, by recipient, by chain)\r\n - get stream by id (and chain)\r\n - get stream history\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## 3. Data updates\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of the application we need to figure out how to update pieces of the data that are time-bound. Every **second** we should find a way to update the stream info (amounts, progress etc.), including status (ongoing, done). There are multiple ways to achieve this:\r\n\r\n1.

I wrote this section to add more color to the problem statement.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, possible to add the following path in any child tsconfig:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"paths\": [\r\n  \"~/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout causing the `yarn tsc` command to fail if you run it within the package's context. However, if you do this, then you will not be able to build the client app. And the explanation for that is ...\r\n\r\n**When you're building the client app, you're using only one TypeScript config to compile the code, and that is the client's `tsconfig.json`**. The TypeScript configs from all other packages will be ignored, and hence their `paths` will also be ignored.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nI came up with two solutions, but it's really only the second solution that I recommend using. The first would be a footgun the size of the Statue of Liberty. I shared it only for informational purposes, to mention that it exists.\r\n\r\n### 1. Using \"~/*\" Globally\r\n\r\nStart from this [`tsconfig.base.json`][1] and re-define the tilde paths like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"paths\": {\r\n  \"~/*\": [\r\n    \"./apps/client/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/assets/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/components/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/constants/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/contexts/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/hooks/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/machines/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/models/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/themes/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/types/src/*\",\r\n    \"./packages/utils/src/*\",\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefining the paths like this (and NOT overwriting them in the child configs) would make it possible to e.g. use `~/atoms` in the `components` package. However, it would not scale well, and here's why.\r\n\r\n**It will force developers to not re-use the same directory names across packages.**\r\n\r\nThat is, you can't define `foo` under `apps/client/src` at the same with defining `foo` under `packages/components/src`, because the paths are globally declared and so TypeScript would find the former `foo` and stop the search there.\r\n\r\n### 2. Global Per-Package Tildes\r\n\r\nWe start from the same [`tsconfig.base.json`][1] and re-define the tilde paths like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"paths\": {\r\n  \"~/client/*\": [\"./apps/client/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/assets/*\": [\"./packages/assets/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/components/*\": [\"./packages/components/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/constants/*\": [\"./packages/constants/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/contexts/*\": [\"./packages/contexts/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/hooks/*\": [\"./packages/hooks/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/machines/*\": [\"./packages/machines/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/models/*\": [\"./packages/models/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/themes/*\": [\"./packages/themes/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/types/*\": [\"./packages/types/src/*\"],\r\n  \"~/utils/*\": [\"./packages/utils/src/*\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you would be able to make imports like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport \"~/components/atoms\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot as great as \"~/atoms\" but as per the explanation given in this discussion, that is simply not possible with the current TypeScript compiler.\r\n\r\nThe only cost of employing this solution would be the refactor needed in the client app, i.e. to turn all `~/` references into `~/client/` references. But that's a small price to pay to gain a bigger advantage, which is the ability to use `~` in all packages, albeit with an additional package prefix (`~/components/`, `~/contexts/`, etc.).\r\n\r\n@razgraf if you like this I can prepare a PR for it.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-interfaces/blob/807868283b59f7fbb3e8476afe81a81e0fc7eac0/tsconfig.base.json","createdAt":"2022-10-20T13:03:10Z","labels":[],"number":66,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Global per-package tilde path like \"~/client/\" instead of \"~/\" so we can use tildes everywhere","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-05-26T13:38:15Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/66"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"We have a `.gitignore` file at the root and one in `apps/client`, and they overlap significantly.

I invite you all to comment on it or suggest tools and configurations that can improve it. Once we have a setup we can all agree on, I will start thinking about milestones and commence work on the core UI components.\r\n\r\n## How to review?\r\nYou can start by exploring the `setup/structure` branch. This one include a no-logic, pure-setup monorepo structure. Please have a look at this [👨‍💻Client Interfaces Setup](https://www.notion.so/sablier/Client-Interfaces-Setup-75fd8bab192e4669bb10a3ab082759d9) page where many of the opinionated choices or implementation caveats have been addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n📦 This setup integrates all the necessary tools for a healthy development environment. To name a few:\r\n- linters and formatters: eslint, stylelint, prettier, commitizen and commitlint\r\n- automation: husky\r\n- workspace: yarn v3\r\n- frameowrks: typescript, nextjs\r\n\r\n🗂 It also includes a proposed folder structure, with more examples to be revealed once we start adding logic.\r\n🧠 It also includes some pro(s) and con(s) or why/why-not(s) for common topics such as color names, css rules ordering etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nNext, you can head over to `setup/starters` where the first Theme has been added to the project. It includes examples of how we'll access common styling such as colors, sizes or media queries. This is where the general part of the setup ends.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can have a look at the `setup/tooling` branch. Here I've already started adding some common components and methods ready to be used across the entire project. This is still in live development. I will keep adding things like `Modals`, `Buttons`, common `contexts` or even a web3 library implementation to this branch over the following days/weeks.\r\n\r\n## What next?\r\nThe final branch, `setup/tooling` is meant to offer examples of the components and logic I've implemented in the past and always end up using (in some form) in client apps. It's also a place to experiment with things such as a web3 library implementation.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'd suggest starting the efforts for the actual `@sablier-v2/*` code from the `setup/starters` branch. This one is both the cleanest and the least cluttered one, such that we don't have to add stuff yet that we may need for later. These type of auxiliaries can be left in the `tooling` branch and brought back later into the main development flow.\r\n\r\nGood luck and please leave your feedback below!\r\n\r\n### Later edit\r\nIn the meantime, I've started actually working on the layouts inside the `develop` branch.","createdAt":"2022-08-22T21:53:53Z","labels":[],"number":1,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Exploring the initial setup","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-05-26T13:34:06Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/1"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"We should consider replacing any pure network requests (e.g. the query for token lists) with [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4).

This means we first want to make sure the query client is declared only client side. Secondly, it provides a [Hydration](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr#using-hydration) utility which helps you sync data requested by the server with the client state.

JavaScript is an oddball.\r\n\r\nAs discussed [here][1], [here][2], and [here][3], the advantages of using semicolons are:\r\n \r\n- Avoid discrepancies when an accidental whitespace causes a statement to be a non-statement, and vice-versa\r\n- Makes it less likely that a JavaScript minifier / compressor will malfunction\r\n- Greater consistency across the board with our other repos (less cognitive load when context switching)\r\n\r\n[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/537632/should-i-use-semicolons-in-javascript?noredirect=1&lq=1\r\n[2]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/444080/3873510\r\n[3]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/4002234/3873510\r\n\r\n## How to Make the Switch\r\n\r\nIf you agree, refactoring the code base to use double quotes is as simple as setting the `semi` setting to `true` in the [Prettier configuration file](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-interfaces/blob/381d6828cbac15cf67ffc2e111a8b6c1998ab88a/.prettierrc#L11), and then run the global Prettier script `g:prettier-fix`.","createdAt":"2022-10-05T10:49:33Z","labels":[],"number":17,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Suggestion to switch to writing semicolons","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-05-26T13:33:47Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/17"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"In one of the comments left in https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-interfaces/pull/14, @razgraf said this:\r\n\r\n> Another comment on repository guidelines: can we keep the name of the PR (not necessarily the branch itself) under the same format as the conventional commits.\r\n>\r\n> \"Make all config files use YAML\" would become \"chore: yaml format for config file\"\r\n\r\nI'm against this, due to a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. First and foremost, a PR need not implement only one type of change (unlike a commit, which often does). A PR can be a combination of a `feat`, a `refactor` and a `chore`.\r\n2. PR names are for informational purposes only. They are never expected to be used in any automation process (unlike git commits, which could be used for automating npm package releases).\r\n3. Non-technical people read repos and PRs, too. This will be relevant especially when we eventually make this repo public.\r\n4. There are GitHub labels that can be used for categorizing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't have a strong opinion. If and when applicable (e.g. the PR is small and has few commits all of the same type) it should be fine to use conventional commits in the PR name, if the author of the PR so wishes. As I said, it's for informational purposes only.\r\n\r\n**Update**: on second thoughts, I don't think this is so much a matter of debate (i.e. if this should be a \"repository guideline\", or not). The first argument given above makes it pretty clear that in several cases it is simply not appropriate to use conventional commit prefixes in PR names, because the PRs might encompass different types of changes.","createdAt":"2022-10-07T13:06:49Z","labels":[],"number":19,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Should we use conventional commits in PR names?","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-05-26T13:33:39Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/19"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"What is the rationale for using a [`printWidth`](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-interfaces/blob/381d6828cbac15cf67ffc2e111a8b6c1998ab88a/.prettierrc#L9) of only 80?\r\n\r\nSeems to be a rather small length.\r\n\r\nAs per this [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/578059/studies-on-optimal-code-width) on StackOverflow, it should be fine to bump this value to 120 or more.

No matter what repo or programming language a Sablier employee is working with, they don't have to think about whether to use single or double quotes.\r\n- With double quotes, you don't have to escape apostrophes (which are common in English)\r\n- In English, it is customary to use double quotes for quoting excerpts from books, articles, etc.\r\n- Broadly speaking, in computer science single quotes are used to refer to single characters and ASCII codes.\r\n\r\n### StackOverflow Discussion\r\n\r\nThe same topic is also discussed on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18041188/3873510), where most users are in favor of using double quotes.\r\n\r\n## How to Make the Switch\r\n\r\nIf you agree, refactoring the code base to use double quotes is as simple as setting the `singleQuote` setting to `false` in the [Prettier configuration file](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-interfaces/blob/381d6828cbac15cf67ffc2e111a8b6c1998ab88a/.prettierrc#L11), and then run the global Prettier script `g:prettier-fix`.","createdAt":"2022-10-05T10:39:53Z","labels":[],"number":15,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Suggestion to switch to double quotes","type":"discussion","updatedAt":"2023-05-26T13:33:27Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/discussions/15"}],"issues":[{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Upstream: https://github.com/PaulRberg/github-labels\n\nMaybe put this logic into the devkit?\n\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/devkit","createdAt":"2025-07-09T12:24:53Z","labels":[],"number":1,"repository":"sablier-labs/github-labels","state":"open","title":"Figure out a way to reduce code between this repo and upstream","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-07-09T12:24:53Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/github-labels/issues/1"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"- [x] Claude settings file\n- [x] Claude bot on GitHub, so that it can be assigned to issues.","createdAt":"2025-07-19T14:22:08Z","labels":["effort: medium","priority: 2","type: feature","work: complicated"],"number":18,"repository":"sablier-labs/sdk","state":"closed","title":"Set up Claude Code","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-08-11T15:50:04Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/sdk/issues/18"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Or maybe there is a way to do this with a type?

contracts in search of possible gas optimizations. The following are possible improvements that can be made to the contracts to save gas.\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer:** I'm by no means an expert on gas optimization, and some or all of my suggestions could be wrong. I just thought it would be fun to contribute to a project that I enjoy using.\r\n\r\n### `createSalary()` - Payroll.sol line 252-273 \r\nA temporary variable `salaryId` is created to represent the global variable `nextSalaryId`. Instead of loading `nextSalaryId` from storage on lines 265 and 269, we can simply use the temporary variable `salaryId`.\r\n\r\n### `hundredPercent` & `onePercent` - Sablier.sol lines 25 & 30\r\nAlthough it may be useful to represent these values as constant global variables, it's quite expensive to pull them out of storage each time they're used. In place of these variables, you will save gas by just referencing the values. \r\n\r\n### `takeEarnings()` - Sablier.sol line 172-187\r\n`earnings[tokenAddress]` is used three times throughout this function. You can save gas by using a temporary variable. This may also be applicable to `withdrawFromCompoundingStreamInternal()` as well as `cancelCompoundingStreamInternal()`.\r\n\r\n### `interestOf()` - Sablier.sol line 351-432\r\nGlobal variable `fee` is used three times. Can be represented with a temporary variable.\r\n\r\n### `createStream()` - Sablier.sol line 473-521\r\nTemporary variable `streamId` is used to represent global variable `nextStreamId`, yet the global variable continues to be used when the temporary variable will suffice.\r\n\r\n ### `getStream()` - Sablier.sol line 197-220\r\nA temporary variable can represent `streams[streamId]`. Same can be done for `getCompoundingStream()` with both `streams[streamId]` and `compoundingStreamVars[streamId]`.\r\n\r\n### `withdrawFromStreamInternal()` - Sablier.sol line 664-678\r\nTemporary variable `stream` is created to represent `streams[streamId]`, which can be used throughout the function. Same thing for `withdrawFromCompoundingStreamInternal()`, `cancelStreamInternal()` and `cancelCompoundingStreamInternal()`.\r\n\r\n### Constant variables - Exponential.sol lines 13-15\r\nIt's costly and unnecessary (as far as I can tell) to assign these values to global variables.\r\n\r\nIf wanted, I will gladly make a pull request to make all these changes, just let me know.

This would remove the need for an extra `refundableAmountOf` call to determine the amount being refunded to the stream sender.\n\nConsider a scenario where a `SablierFlowManager` [contract](https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/flow/FlowStreamManager.sol) is responsible for creating new streams. To enable guarded management operations (e.g., pausing or canceling), the manager contract acts as the sender (see a related discussion [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/discussions/977)). Consequently, when a refund occurs, all funds are sent to the manager contract, which is then responsible for forwarding them to the original stream sender.\n\nCurrently, an additional `refundableAmountOf` call is required before invoking `refundMax` to know the actual amount that will be refunded by the manager contract.\n\nThis would also align with the behavior of `withdrawMax`.","createdAt":"2025-05-06T11:30:50Z","labels":["effort: low","priority: 2","type: feature","work: clear"],"number":444,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Return refunded amount on `refundMax` call","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-05-08T10:37:20Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/issues/444"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"Similar to https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/1224.","createdAt":"2025-04-30T20:55:36Z","labels":["type: refactor","effort: low","priority: 2","work: clear"],"number":442,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Refactor \"FlowBase\" into \"FlowState\"","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-05-20T18:14:37Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/issues/442"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"","createdAt":"2025-04-28T09:16:06Z","labels":["effort: low","priority: 2","work: clear","type: chore"],"number":441,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Bump forge-std to v1.9.7","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-05-02T16:08:32Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/issues/441"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"Similar to https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/141","createdAt":"2025-04-11T19:39:11Z","labels":["priority: 1","effort: medium","type: feature","work: clear"],"number":436,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Role-Based Access Control","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-04-19T12:46:04Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/issues/436"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"As discussed in https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/discussions/430, since foundry can handle autoremappings, delete `remappings.txt` file.","createdAt":"2025-04-09T23:52:53Z","labels":["effort: low","type: build","priority: 2","work: clear"],"number":433,"repository":"sablier-labs/flow","state":"closed","title":"Delete remappings.txt","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T21:29:58Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/issues/433"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem\n\nAs explained by Max [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/command-center/discussions/119), there's a need for automating the fee management _after_ the fees are collected.\n\nAs of now, automating this process is difficult because the fees can only be collected to the admin contract, which is a multisig on some chains.

This means that on Tuesday (April 1), we need to collect the fees across all blockchains.\n\n## Task\n\n- [x] Create a new EOA that is specifically used for paying the gas for collecting the fees\n    - The EOA will be a personal account. I will personally provide the funds (as a one-time transfer), but I'd appreciate it @smol-ninja if you could handle the bridging/transfers from your end. Transak might be helpful here.\n- [x] Write a script that iterates over all Sablier deployments, and calls the `collectFees` function on all relevant contracts, including all Merkle campaigns.\n    - The [deployments package](https://github.com/sablier-labs/deployments/issues/21) might be helpful here (once we build it)!\n- [x] The script should generate a CSV artifact with the following info: tx hash, UTC timestamp, fee amount collected, and other useful info. Errors should also be logged in the CSV.\n- [ ] Write a GitHub Actions workflow that runs this script on the 1st date of each month\n\n### Low-Value\n\nFor simplicity, the script should NOT care about the USD value of the fee amount — unless it's zero, in which case the call should not be made.\n\n### Structure\n\nI will let you @smol-ninja decide between:\n\n1. Create a new GitHub repo specifically for the collection scripts and any admin-specific functionality in the EVM contracts\n2. OR turn the [multichain-deployer](https://github.com/sablier-labs/multichain-deployer) into something like `multichain-scripts` or `multichain-utils`\n\nI'm on the fence.

If we have a stream where the owner actually used `4.0.0` the flow will simply stop before checking the older version, and mark this as being a non-proxy.\n\n1. Fetch the `4.0.1` proxy from the registry\n2. Ok, found one, don't go in the `4.0.0` branch _// it skips although our stream was using the `4.0.0` registry_\n3. Since the proxy address is not the one I was expecting, return `undefined`\n\n#### Solution\n\nInstead, the flow should ask both registries about the proxy address `registry.getProxy(owner)` and compare the results, or at least consider going in the `4.0.0` branch when a `4.0.1` result is found but still incompatible (later edit: what ended up being implememented). If one of them is true (meaning a registry has identified the proxy as being valid), we have a proper `proxied` stream on our hands. This covers any case where an owner might have both versions - so streams using the older one will be scanned as well.\n\n\n### The Graph issue\n\nFurther checks revealed that the mainnet the-graph indexer (deployed here [/82/sablier-lockup-experimental-2](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/82/sablier-lockup-experimental-2/version/latest)) only indexes proxies for two streams (both using proxy version `4.0.0`) - `LD-1-1` and `LL-1-1`.\n\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/blob/db964df7b9289a42326bd3a8ad5f05653ded8a73/graph/lockup/helpers/prb-proxy.ts#L20-L27\n\nThe conditional statement on line **24** should've actually been:\n```ts\n if (reverse.reverted || reverse.value.equals(Address.zero())) // notice the lack of `!`\n```\n\nThe older logic made it so, any tests for streams with proxy `4.0.1` be overwritten (since the `reverse` value wasn't address `zero`).\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe general issue will affect the code here anyway, so that's where the final solution is :D \n\n","createdAt":"2025-07-25T12:05:19Z","labels":["priority: 2","work: complicated","type: bug"],"number":183,"repository":"sablier-labs/indexers","state":"open","title":"Fix logic in proxy resolution","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-07-29T08:33:11Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/issues/183"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"An idea shared by Derek from BuildersDAO\n\n```graphql\nentity IndexerInfo @entity(immutable: true) {\n  commitHash: string; # git commit when deployment was made\n  protocol: string; # one of \"airdrops\", \"flow\", or \"lockup\"\n  deployedAt: Timestamp! # unix timestamp when deployment was made\n  versionLabel: string; # same as subgraph version label, e.g., v2.0--v1.0.0-beta.1\n}\n```","createdAt":"2025-07-22T10:20:45Z","labels":["priority: 3","effort: low","work: clear","type: feature"],"number":182,"repository":"sablier-labs/indexers","state":"open","title":"Introduce \"IndexerInfo\" entity for indexer metadata information (runs only once on first block)","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-07-22T10:20:45Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/issues/182"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem\n\nIn PR #92, I introduced two new entities called `User` and `Revenue` for tracking our KPIs using Envio.

The user data is split among three different indexers, which means we cannot easily get an aggregate view of out entire user base.\n  - Envio introduced a new [`User_aggregate`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/issues/175) feature, which is cool, but it cannot be used across indexers.\n2.

The handler entrypoints shouldn't change that often in the KPIs indexer (since we will just be parsing the `event.params.*` and calling a helper that inserts the data in the database).\n\n###

`packages/*` are not actually packages.\n\nThe only code shipped to production from this repo is the `apps/*`. But the apps are built using [Next.js's SWC](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) compiler.\n\nThe code under `packages/*` is NOT transpiled to JS — for good reason. Doing so would lead to a bad development experience as we would have to keep the TypeScript compiler on hot reload, all the time.\n\nIt thus follows that the `package.json` files are superfluous. The `dependencies` and `devDependencies` do not do anything besides creating a significant maintenance cost. All of those dependencies could be moved to the root `package.json` (or one of the `apps/*` `package.json`, and everything would work the same). The only exception is the `scripts`. More on this below under the **Solution**.\n\n### No Official Guidance\n\nIt's worth noting that more than two years ago, I've asked for help on Next.js's forum:\n\n- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/50866\n- [Best practices on using Next.js in a TypeScript monorepo](https://community.vercel.com/t/best-practices-on-using-next-js-in-a-typescript-monorepo/7131/2)\n\nUnfortunately, I've never received an answer. It looks like Next.js itself doesn't provide any official recommendation when it comes to monorepos.\n\n## Solution\n\nGet rid of the `package.json` files \n\nThe `scripts` functionality can be replaced with [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) files (and Just provides a superior UX anyway).\n\nNote: this issue goes hand in hand with

Flow is fine because it enforces tokens to have <= 18 decimals.\n\nI investigated this and I was able to deploy an airdrop campaign using a test NFT contract I deployed on Sepolia:\n\nhttps://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x4d9cb0b7ae59a3c3622237e22530a650fc5f0ad73a8659f3329876fb94eb6ad6\n\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34fde537-a544-4d6f-a749-37cdeceeec4a\" />\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ea6447c-0e20-4a5d-aa58-77ef0743423f\" />\n\n### Production User\n\nThere is also a production user who created a `MerkleInstant` campaign using an NFT: \n\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/issues/150\n- https://abscan.org/tx/0x732d76e98df7bd32711974150466ff2f2afa94d98607490c7a1fe411b6489a07\n\n## Solution\n\nIn the creation form, do this:\n\n- When the token is not part of the EVM token list, add a guard check by querying the [ERC-165 `supportsInterface`](https://ercs.ethereum.org/ERCS/erc-721) method on the token contract.\n- The argument to pass to this method is [`0x80ac58cd`](https://github.com/binodnp/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/ffc4bcbba398b61d19ede03e4fdf673ddbce1083/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L34)\n- If the contract call is successful and the returned value is `true`, the user should NOT be allowed to proceed.\n- If the contract call reverts, then the user should be allowed to proceed (because ERC-20 doesn't implement ERC-165 and there's no `supportsInterface` method on it).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> It is not worth implementing a check against NFTs in the Lockup contracts because: (i) this is a low-probability scenario and it's not fair to ask 99.8% of users to pay the gas cost for a check they don't need, and (ii) the Lockup contract's size is 'scarce' as we're approaching the contract size limit enforced by the EVM.\n> However, we may want to consider implementing this check in the Merkle factories (regardless of whether we do this or not, the UI should still perform this check to serve as a double layer of defense).\n\n### Related\n\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1587\n- https://github.com/wevm/viem/discussions/3752","createdAt":"2025-06-18T12:13:42Z","labels":["type: bug","priority: 1","effort: low","work: clear"],"number":1709,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Users should not be allowed to create invalid streams or airdrops with NFTs","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-06-18T12:23:02Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1709"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## How to Reproduce\n\n1.

validating the `Clawback` Ix:\n```rust\npub fn check_clawback(expiration_time: i64, first_claim_time: i64) -> Result<()> {\n    // Check: the grace period has passed and the campaign has not expired.\n    if has_grace_period_passed(first_claim_time)? && !has_expired(expiration_time)? {\n        return Err(ErrorCode::ClawbackNotAllowed.into());\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\npub fn has_expired(expiration_time: i64) -> Result<bool> {\n    let current_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;\n\n    Ok(expiration_time > 0 && expiration_time <= current_time)\n}\n\npub fn has_grace_period_passed(first_claim_time: i64) -> Result<bool> {\n    let current_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;\n    let grace_period = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 7 days in seconds\n\n    Ok(first_claim_time > 0 && current_time > first_claim_time + grace_period)\n}\n```\n\nThe problems with this approach are that:\n1. “grace period” normally means “you can be late [to **_pay_** for smth you **_have to_** buy] without penalty.” We're, however, using it to refer to a period during which the campaign creator has the **_opportunity/option_**  to get the funds **_back to themselves_**;\n2. the validations are hard to follow, being \n    - distributed across multiple functions,\n    - wrapped around the terms that name them (sometimes, incorrectly).\n\n### The proposed solution\n\nReplace the above with inline checks that read top-to-bottom and don't require you to do the mental unwrapping and memorization to understand:\n```rust\npub fn check_clawback(expiration_time: i64, first_claim_time: i64) -> Result<()> {\n    // Allow clawback if no claims have been made yet or the campaign has already expired\n    if first_claim_time == 0 || has_expired(expiration_time)? {\n        return Ok(());\n    }\n\n    // Allow clawback if less than a week has passed since the first claim.\n    let current_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;\n    let a_week_past_first_claim = first_claim_time + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60;\n    if current_time < a_week_past_first_claim {\n        return Ok(());\n    }\n\n    // Otherwise, disallow clawback.\n    Err(ErrorCode::ClawbackNotAllowed.into())\n}\n\npub fn has_expired(expiration_time: i64) -> Result<bool> {\n    let current_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;\n\n    Ok(expiration_time > 0 &&

There is no guarantee that the `MAX_COUNT` will remain accurate over time.\n     - This is an artificial limitation that harms business for Sablier (by arbitrarily limiting how many segments/tranches there can be a in stream, when in fact there may be more).\n- The UI will switch to an [optimistic approach](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1473#issuecomment-2729865961) that simulates the stream creation before submitting the tx. The same approach will enable us to check if the user-provided segment count\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> It's safe to do this because the gas cost of storing segments outweighs the gas cost of traversing them.

We recently conducted a systematic study on the causes, effects, and fixes of the inconsistent state update vulnerability in solidity. We are attempting to build a tool to detect bugs about state updates based on our findings. We have tried our prototype tool on some popular Github solidity repositories, and for your repository, we found that there are missing state updates or gas consumption that can be optimized.\n\nThe point is that when we declare a state variable in the contract, if the variable is not reassigned throughout the project, it may be a missed state update, including balance, order number, counter, contract status flag, etc. Of course, it may also be a state variable with special purposes that does not need to be changed, such as maximum supply, contract administrator address, configuration information, etc. When declaring these state variables that do not need to be changed, the _constant_ or _immutable_ modifier should be used as required, which will save gas.\n\nFor your repository, we found the following state variables that may need attention. If you are not forgetting to update them, perhaps you should declare them with the _constant_ or _immutable_ modifier:\n\n[Benchmark.t.sol](https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/blob/main/benchmark/Benchmark.t.sol)\n**State variable:** benchmarkResults\n```solidity\nstring internal benchmarkResults = \"benchmark/results/\";\n```\n\n[batch.t.sol](https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/blob/main/tests/unit/concrete/batch/batch.t.sol)\n**State variable:** newNumber\n```solidity\nuint256 internal newNumber = 100;\n```\n\nDo you find our results useful? Your reply and invaluable suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and are vital for improving our tool. Thanks a lot for your time!\n(The reason why _constant_ and _immutable_ modifiers can save gas is that they do not consume storage space within the EVM. Their values are compiled directly into smart contract bytecode, which reduces the gas cost of storage. This storage method also avoids the SLOAD operation that reads EVM storage (costs about 100 gas in EVM). The main difference between _constant_ and _immutable_ variables is that the value of _immutable_ variables can be set in the constructor, and _immutable_ variables may cost more gas than _constant_ variables.

This could be helpful for users as well as the Sablier UI to show the funding status of the campaign.\n\n### Tasks\n\n- [ ] Store `aggregateAmount` in a state variable. This would be set at constructor.\n- [ ] Store `totalClaimedAmount` in a state variable. This would be updated during claim.\n- [ ] Getter returns funding status: `UNFUNDED`, `PARTIALLY_FUNDED`, `FULLY_FUNDED` by checking `aggregateAmount - totalClaimedAmount <= token.balanceOf(this)`.\n\n### Remarks\n\nI understand that `aggregateAmount` cannot be trusted, but given that all the valid campaigns are and will be created through Sablier or partner UI, we can optimistically assume it to be accurate. Moreover, `aggregateAmount` does not interfere with `claim`, so even if it's incorrectly set, it will not have any impact on the claim.\n\nOne other advantage of storing `aggregateAmount` will be in the MerkleVCA campaign with redistribution strategy (which I will explain in a separate discussion).\n\n\n### Risks\n\nThe argument that a malicious campaign creator could deploy a campaign by providing an incorrect value for `aggregateAmount` and trick users into believing an incorrect state of funding is weak. This is because the biggest risk with a malicious user is providing an incorrect Merkle root or not funding the campaign at all, which anyways is never in our control.\n\nCriticisms are Welcome!","createdAt":"2025-03-21T23:06:33Z","labels":["effort: low","priority: 2","type: feature","work: clear"],"number":114,"repository":"sablier-labs/airdrops","state":"closed","title":"Getter to determine campaign funding state","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-04-02T18:21:34Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/114"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Zero is used a sentinel value for `startTime`.\n\nWhen users set `startTime` to zero, we will set the start time to `block.timestamp`.\n\nIt'd be nice to provide a constant in the tests for this, something like `START_NOW = 0`, or `START_AT_BLOCK_TIMESTAMP = 0`, and use that instead of zero throughout the tests.","createdAt":"2025-03-21T20:56:06Z","labels":["effort: high","priority: 2","type: test","work: clear"],"number":113,"repository":"sablier-labs/airdrops","state":"closed","title":"Add a sentinel value constant for `startTime == 0`","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-03-23T11:59:50Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/113"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"As discussed [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/106#issuecomment-2741782757), it'd be cleaner for the `schedule` struct in `MerkleVCA` to be refactored into separate `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` values.","createdAt":"2025-03-21T12:31:06Z","labels":["effort: low","priority: 2","type: refactor","work: clear"],"number":111,"repository":"sablier-labs/airdrops","state":"closed","title":"Turn \"timestamps\" into \"START_TIME\" and \"END_TIME\"","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-03-24T22:36:05Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/111"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Similar to https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/105 but for the foregone amount:\n\n```solidity\nfunction calculateForgoneAmount(uint128 fullAmount, uint40 claimTime) external view returns (uint128);\n```\n","createdAt":"2025-03-20T21:13:26Z","labels":["effort: medium","priority: 2","type: feature","work: clear"],"number":108,"repository":"sablier-labs/airdrops","state":"closed","title":"Getter for calculating forgone amount","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-03-24T21:48:59Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/108"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"For consistency with the MerkleLL contract, we could rename the `timestamps` to `getSchedule`:\n\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/blob/41f2e742744caabd64c388a32aa6eaf26bbe4654/src/interfaces/ISablierMerkleVCA.sol#L26","createdAt":"2025-03-20T20:21:15Z","labels":["effort: low","priority: 3","type: refactor","work: clear"],"number":106,"repository":"sablier-labs/airdrops","state":"closed","title":"Rename \"timestamps\" to \"schedule\" in VCA","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-03-21T13:54:24Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/airdrops/issues/106"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"In the VCA contract, we absolutely need a new getter for calculating the claim amount.

Here is a [quick guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/sunrise/#how-do-i-upgrade-my-hosted-service-subgraph) with all the upgrade steps.\n\nIf you're not the subgraph owner or maintainer, check [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) to see if the subgraph development team has already upgraded to the network. If you don’t find an upgraded subgraph, a friendly nudge to the subgraph development team would be greatly appreciated—it's a quick process that benefits everyone. Here's the [upgrade guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/sunrise/#how-do-i-upgrade-my-hosted-service-subgraph) with all the necessary steps for the subgraph development team.\n\nOnce the subgraph is upgraded to the network, you can [create an API key and updated query URL](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/) in Subgraph Studio then update this repository to query from the new endpoint, `https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<ID>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/<VERSION>`\n\nNeed more support or have more questions?

Furthermore, it might play to Sablier's advantage as a business to _not_ take any responsibility regarding proxies, given how difficult they are to get right (computational universality à la [`execute`](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy/blob/6fbb6df62d25e07fc702a4485595aa34d8297237/src/PRBProxy.sol#L87) begets errors).\r\n\r\nSide note: I should also [consider](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy/issues/112) turning the PRBProxy repo into a monorepo 🤔","createdAt":"2023-06-15T09:12:30Z","labels":[],"number":7,"repository":"sablier-labs/indexers","state":"closed","title":"Move PRBProxy to a separate repo","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-12-07T17:14:40Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/issues/7"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"As discussed in #2 , the field `type` may cause some conflicts due to it already being heavily used by languages (and libraries).

I value this a lot, because it makes reading code much easier.\r\n- [x] I've seen a few props passed down to styled-components like this: \"cleanStyle\". Our preferred way to name this is \"isStyleClean\", to avoid collisions with html-specific props.\r\n- [x] I would rename the \"react-hooks\" folder to \"hooks\". It's self-evident what it does. The reason for which the \"react-hooks\" package has the \"react-\" prefix is because it's much more likely for there to be a naming collision across the whole npmjs.com registry.\r\n- [x] I've seen you used \"isUndefined\" a couple of times. This is not a robust way to check for invalidness. We should use \"isFalsy\", which covers the whole spectrum of invalid values in JavaScript.\r\n- [x] The \"ProfilePage\" and \"RequestPage\" folders under \"dotme/components\" should really be renamed to \"Profile\" and \"Request\", just like \"CreateStream\" is different to \"CreateStreamPage\" in \"sender-app\"\r\n\r\nAbout the input. I agree that we should keep the code DRY and reuse the \"AmountInput\" and \"DurationInput\" components across \"sender-app\" and \"dotme-app\". It's not going to be easy though to do this.\r\n\r\nFinally, about the \"/request\" route and component. I would really, really, hold on to it for now. It adds a lot of complexity to the codebase, it increases the development time to get sablier.me out and the payoff is super small.

They provide critical information for onchain integrators. Imagine needing to know the stream IDs that have just been created. It's impossible to do that now when `batch` is used.\n2. The additional gas cost isn't much.\n\nI've made a gas comparison:\n\n- [Without returned results: 257,276](https://app.warp.dev/block/hh0SOGAzBcJMQJJfI9x2KT)\n- [With returned results: 261,698](https://app.warp.dev/block/vc2b6D03qqMDa0MRSCtVeO)\n\nSo it's only 4422 extra gas for creating two streams, i.e., extra ~2.2k gas per created streams. Small price to pay.\n\n## Resources\n\nCheck out [PRBProxy](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy) for inspiration on how to bubble up the revert, as well as this [StackExchange Q&A](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/145042/24693).\n\nNote: unlike in PRBProxy, let's NOT revert with a custom error when the revert `response` is empty.

Approve the intermediary contract to transfer the stream's NFT by calling the `SablierV2Lockup.approve` method;\r\n2. Withdraw the maximum withdrawable amount from the stream by calling the `withdrawMax` method;\r\n3. Transfer the NFT by calling the `transferFrom` exposed by the `SablierV2Lockup` implementation;\r\n\r\nWith all that said, should only the stream recipient be able to transfer the NFT? If so, the workflow above should not be allowed. Otherwise, if that's not an issue, is there another way to accomplish it?\r\n\r\nThanks!</div>","createdAt":"2024-10-04T10:53:29Z","labels":["type: refactor","priority: 2","effort: low","work: clear"],"number":1051,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"The NFT operator should be allowed to call \"withdrawMaxAndTransfer\"","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2024-10-08T19:33:27Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/1051"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Starting [Solidity v0.8.21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.21), events can be emitted from interface files.\r\n\r\nSo we can get rid of the `Events.t.sol` file and duplicated events there and instead import the interface files from `src`.","createdAt":"2024-09-19T11:13:11Z","labels":["priority: 2","type: test","effort: low","work: clear"],"number":1045,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Get rid of \"Events\" helper in tests","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2024-11-01T12:55:36Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/1045"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"### Discussed in https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/903\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **smol-ninja** April 16, 2024</sup>\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> The below proposal is for future release of Lockup and not v2.2.\r\n\r\nContext\r\n---------\r\nIn the current design of Lockup linear, the amount unlocked at `cliff` is a function of the time elapsed. That is, if the cliff timestamp is 30% ahead of the start time, this would unlock 30% of the total amount at the cliff. This makes it less flexible for creating a cliff linear vesting.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> In a cliff linear vesting, token distributions include a preset amount unlocked at the cliff followed by a linear distribution. The amount unlocks at the cliff can be any and does not need to follow the curve slope.\r\n\r\nExisting solution\r\n---------\r\nA Cliff linear vesting can be created using Lockup Dynamic (LD). It has a few problems:\r\n1. It is not intuitive to use LD for creating Linear streams with cliffs.\r\n2. Creating a cliff linear vesting stream is less gas efficient (same argument as [why we chose to implement lockup tranched](https://github.com/sablier-labs/company-discussions/discussions/19)). \r\n3. Despite having a cliff feature in Lockup Linear (LL), it does not support Cliff linear vesting. \r\n\r\nProposed solution\r\n---------\r\nModify the Lockup Linear design to allow the creation of cliff linear vesting streams. So that,\r\n1. LL can be used to create streams with unlocks instantly followed by a linear curve (as requested by one of our users). \r\n2. LL can be used to create a stream with a fixed amount of unlock at a cliff time followed by a linear curve.\r\n3. it becomes more gas-efficient than doing the same with LD.\r\n4. Existing curves such as Unlock-cliff and Unlock-linear on Sablier UI will become gas efficient. Because they are created using LD at present. \r\n\r\nWe might also add two percentages representing: (i) instant unlocked amount (ii) cliff amount.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif block.timestamp < cliffTime:\r\n    streamedAmount = deposited * instantUnlockPct # instant unlocked amount\r\nelse:\r\n    # elapsed time is defined from cliff time\r\n    elapsedTime = (block.timestamp - cliffTime) / (endTime - cliffTime)\r\n    streamedAmount = deposited * instantUnlockPct # instant unlocked amount\r\n                   + deposited * cliffUnlockPct  # cliff unlocked amount\r\n                    # stream linearly from cliff time\r\n                   + deposited * (1 - instantUnlockPct - cliffUnlockPct) * elapsedTime\r\n```","createdAt":"2024-09-16T11:58:43Z","labels":["type: feature","effort: epic","priority: 1","work: complicated"],"number":1043,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Instant unlock + more flexible cliff in LockupLinear","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T16:27:17Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/1043"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem\n\nThe `OR` clauses in our GraphQL queries contain repeated logic in the `AND` sub-clauses — this leads to a high maintenance cost for devs, and an impaired performance for the GraphQL engine (because each sub-clause needs to be parsed independently):\n\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/blob/cab40248a61f3823b425737f82b0314b14108c3c/packages/subgraphs/src/documents/flow/queries.ts#L521-L538\n\n## Solution\n\nDefine the common fields before the `OR` clause, like so:\n\n```graphql\nwhere: {\n  subgraphId_lt: $subgraphId\n  chainId:        $chainId\n  or: [\n    { sender:    $sender }\n    { recipient: $recipient }\n  ]\n}\n```","createdAt":"2025-05-29T11:44:44Z","labels":["priority: 2","effort: low","type: perf","work: clear"],"number":1653,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"Simplify OR clauses in GraphQL queries","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-06-02T13:04:07Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1653"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem\n\nThere is a lot of repeated logic in our GraphQL queries, e.g. the `getStreams` queries for Flow are mostly the same except for the `where: {} `filters:\n\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/blob/cab40248a61f3823b425737f82b0314b14108c3c/packages/subgraphs/src/documents/flow/queries.ts#L259-L290\n\n\n## Solution\n\nWe can replace all those 17 separate queries (and a few related hooks) with a simple query that defines the `$where` clause as an input, like so:\n\n```typescript\nexport const getStreams = gql(/* GraphQL */ `\n  query getStreams($first: Int!, $skip: Int!, $where: Stream_filter!) {\n    streams(\n      first: $first\n      skip: $skip\n      orderBy: subgraphId\n      orderDirection: desc\n      where: $where\n    ) {\n      ...StreamFragment\n      actions(\n        orderBy: timestamp\n        orderDirection: desc\n        where: { category_in: [Create, Adjust, Pause, Void, Restart] }\n      ) {\n        ...ActionFragment\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`);\n```\n","createdAt":"2025-05-29T11:41:52Z","labels":["priority: 1","effort: high","type: refactor","work: complicated"],"number":1652,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"open","title":"DRY-ify GraphQL queries by using `$where` as an input","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-06-02T21:53:41Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1652"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"We need this because:\n\n1.

See my dummy function `decodeGasConsumption` on the [`feat/dynamic-limits-prb`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/tree/feat/dynamic-limits-prb) branch.\n\n### Safe SDK Implementation\n\nThis is how Safe decodes the revert data in their Protocol Kit:\n\nhttps://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/4f4a0f63d57bd6d7ecac85e5b68d75d70521432f/packages/protocol-kit/src/utils/transactions/gas.ts#L353C1-L358C2\n\n## Our Business Logic\n\nAfter the gas estimate is decoded, we can compare it to the chain's block gas limit.\n\nThe gas estimate should be added to a **safety buffer** (say, 5% of the block gas limit) to account for potential errors AND for the gas consumption of Safe's signature verification.\n\nI still suggest [querying the block gas limit](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1424) instead of hard-coding the values. This is a simple request that can be made silently in the background whenever the user switches the network.\n\n### Caveats\n\n1. The simulate feature is available only in Safe v1.3.0 and above, which means we need to block older Safes from interacting with Sablier, and ask the user to go to upgrade their Safes first. However, this should be alright since [v1.2.0](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/releases/tag/v1.2.0) was released in Jan 2020 — there are important security upgrades available in the new versions, so there are important reasons for upgrading anyway!\n2. Safe multisigs with many signers may consume more gas than simple 2-of-3 multisigs, but the 5% buffer should account for that.\n\n## References\n\n- https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1473\n- [Estimating the gas cost for a batch transaction in Safe](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/168410/24693)\n- [What is the difference between safe-apps-sdk and safe-core-sdk?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/168412/24693)\n- https://github.com/safe-global/safe-apps-sdk/issues/469","createdAt":"2025-04-03T18:10:56Z","labels":["type: feature","priority: 0","effort: high","work: complicated"],"number":1564,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Spec for using \"simulateAndRevert\" to simulate batch txs in Safe","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-05-04T14:08:51Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1564"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Problem\n\nUsers are not informed when they are connected to chain X, but they have streams on other chains Y, W, Z, etc. As a result, some users might mistakenly assume that they don't have any incoming streams.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> At ETHBucharest, we met a Sablier user in person who said that the UX is very bad because of this problem.

Why should we go with one or the other?\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, `streamedAmount` is nice because it mirrors the Lockup functions. On the other hand, it is misleading because unlike in Lockup, this value goes down when a withdrawal is made. It is _not_ a monotonically increasing value.\r\n\r\nDebt seems more accurate. Why? Let's look at the definition of debt according to the first result on Google:\r\n \r\n> a sum of money that is owed or due\r\n\r\nFundamentally, Flow is a debt-tracking product. Whether the debt is funded or not is a different matter altogether. This is why I have renamed the simple `debt` to `uncoveredDebt`.\r\n\r\nP.S. a good alternative name is `dueAmountOf`, but I find `totalDebtOf` clearer because it allows to draw a distinction between the different subtypes of debts existing in Flow.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nI will include this change in my upcoming PR.

However, the internal storage can still be in an 18-decimal format, so we will need to add a new function `_calculateDepositAmount`.\r\n\r\nFor assets with decimals greater than 18, I believe we will need to restrict the last decimals to zeros (the difference between decimals and 18). For example, the transfer amount divided by $10^{18}$ must be equal to $10^{normalizingFactor}$ so that assets won’t be stuck in the contract. Yes, it is a limitation, but it wouldn’t lead to loss of funds from other streams. Also, there are almost no assets with more than 18 decimals.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    function _calculateDepositAmount(uint128 transferAmount, uint8 assetDecimals) internal pure returns (uint128) {\r\n        // Return the original amount if asset's decimals are already 18.\r\n        if (assetDecimals == 18) {\r\n            return transferAmount;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (assetDecimals > 18) {\r\n            uint8 normalizingFactor = assetDecimals - 18;\r\n            uint256 factor = 10 ** normalizingFactor;\r\n\r\n            if (uint256(transferAmount) / 1e18 != factor) {\r\n                revert InvalidDepositAmount();\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            return (transferAmount / factor).toUint128();\r\n        } else {\r\n            uint8 normalizingFactor = 18 - assetDecimals;\r\n            return (transferAmount * (10 ** normalizingFactor)).toUint128();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n``` \r\n---\r\n\r\n@smol-ninja Please lmk if I have missed something in my proposed fix, or if you have a better idea on how address this bug.

we bumped into a problem with Safe, which was explained by @gavriliumircea [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1473#issuecomment-2743742756).

This recipient would immediately claim their allocation after the campaign is created (either automatically through the UI or manually later), verifying that the claim process works as expected.

In case Defi projects would stream to recipients the same applies to cancelMultiple and cancel where the amount refunded has to be queried with `refundableAmountOf` upfront.\r\n\r\n### Recommendation\r\nConsider returning the withdrawn amount for withdrawMax and withdrawMaxAndTransfer . The other withdraw don't need this as the amounts are specified as input.

It's easy for a human to make mental calculations from bespoke dates to relative durations (from present time).\n\nSo, to continue with the example mentioned above, the task is to do this:\n\n- [ ] Display `Apr 15 '25 @ 5pm` instead of `6 months (24%)`\n- [ ] Remove `(Ongoing)` copyright","createdAt":"2025-01-20T12:45:50Z","labels":["priority: 3","effort: low","type: perf","work: clear"],"number":1329,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Remove percentage for ongoing cliff in Attributes","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-01-28T12:27:52Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1329"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Requested by Primex:\n\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e68c9d65-ab26-438b-87bc-78efd5f71763\" />\n\nThis is a feature already supported by the contracts, so it's only a matter of implementing in the UI.\n\nP.S. it's nice to see that users having such an in-depth understanding of the product.","createdAt":"2025-01-20T11:44:01Z","labels":["type: feature","priority: 2","effort: high","work: clear"],"number":1328,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Implement cliff shape in Airstreams to allow airdrops with vesting period that starts at claim time","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-01-28T12:29:08Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1328"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"A brilliant suggestion made by the Ultra.io team (a potential Sablier user interested in sponsoring a deployment to a new chain).\n\nI'll just paste the screenshot so that I don't have to re-explain it in my own words:\n\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8bf2f8d-7622-48b0-9ff5-4363df636c61\" />\n\nI have marked this as `priority: 1` because this particular seems quite adamant about being able to pre-select their chain, and I would like us to get paid for making the deployment 😅","createdAt":"2025-01-16T16:27:35Z","labels":["type: feature","priority: 1","effort: low","work: clear"],"number":1326,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Make it possible to pre-select the chain using an URL param","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2025-01-27T15:56:04Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/1326"},{"author":"smol-ninja","body":"If the stream duration is less than a day, the shape should display hourly legends on x-axis instead of daily.

Vercel-logic: [Vercel Firewall](https://vercel.com/docs/security/vercel-waf/rate-limiting) (hosting)\n   a. Rule added to `api/merkle/claimable` and `api/merkle/hidden` to prevent more than 20 requests per 60 seconds coming from the same IP\n3. App-server communication (end-to-end)\n  a. The route behind `api/merkle/eligibility` that calls for proof generation requires a valid Google Captcha token.

Bearer tokens for `@sablier/services` and `@sablier/merkle-api`\n4. Server scaling\n  a. The merkle tree generation happens through the rust-server\n  b.

Writing updates to campaign managed details and processing campaigns (inserting eligibility details in the DB) happens through the `processor` side of the `@sablier/services` \n5.

Adversarial contexts. The proxy contract may perform a flash loan, and a competing flash borrower who sees their tx in the mempool could block it by withdrawing the assets to their EOA.\r\n2. Griefing: deliberately blocking someone's proxy contract transactions for no particular benefit.\r\n3. Tax implications. Withdrawing assets from the proxy contract might be interpreted as a taxable event.\r\n\r\n## Potential Solution\r\n\r\nThe `lockup` address is a user-provided function parameter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-periphery/blob/e62b768026d5df52a3df340cd0df108bf455629e/src/SablierV2ProxyPlugin.sol#L37\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult to mitigate the problem. The only solution I can think of now is to add an allowlist of Sablier contract addresses in `SablierV2ProxyPlugin` and cross-check `lockup` against it. However, implementing this would also require us to inherit from `Adminable` and write an admin-gated function for listing new contracts, i.e., `addSablierContract`, which would be demanding.","createdAt":"2023-05-05T10:00:32Z","labels":[],"number":36,"repository":"sablier-labs/v2-periphery","state":"closed","title":"Figure out a way to prevent direct calls to the plugin","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-05-11T09:31:14Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/issues/36"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The code still refers to Airdrops as Drops.

I typically think of tests in the Arrange, Act, Assert phases which correlate to Given, When, Then in Cucumber style notation.  But it looks like you are combining the current state of the system and the current action into a single statement like \"when the admin is not the same as the current admin\" (line 8).  I think this is a little confusing (or at least it was to me on the first read) because it's not clear in which instances we are talking about function arguments and where we are talking about the state of the system without context clues.  And admittedly this situation wasn't too hard to parse.\r\n>\r\n> Looking at [`transferAdmin`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/main/test/unit/concrete/adminable/transfer-admin/transferAdmin.tree):\r\n>\r\n> - On line 2, \"the admin\" refers to the currently set admin (state of the system)\r\n> - On line 8, \"the admin\" refers to the function parameter, and \"current admin\" is referring to the state of the system\r\n>\r\n> To be clear I really like the branching idea for keeping the information DRY, but I wonder if there is a way to make it slightly more explicit without the need for a full description of the prior state which can be verbose.

The stream would still be in `ACTIVE` state, even though it is past the `endTime`, this could be confusing for end users or developers who build on top of Sablier.\r\n\r\nHe correctly pointed out that the `ACTIVE` enum value is misleading when the end time is in the past. Furthermore, the enum is also confusing when the start time is in the future, as the stream is not actively streaming. Essentially, the `Status` enum is overly simplistic and fails to accurately represent the nuances of lockup streaming.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the pseudo-status \"settled\" in #422 has only exacerbated this confusion. In that discussion, I referred to \"settled\" as a \"sub-status\" of the `ACTIVE` status. However, upon further reflection, this classification seems nonsensical. Instead, \"settled\" should be considered a separate status altogether.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Extend the `Status` enum\r\n    - Delete `ACTIVE`\r\n    - Add `PENDING`: status when start time in the future\r\n    - Add `STREAMING`: status when the start time in the past and the refundable amount is not zero\r\n    - Add `SETTLED`: status when the refundable amount is zero\r\n- Delete the `status` field from stream structs\r\n- Add three new flags in the stream structs: `isStream` (for checking nullness), `isCanceled`, and `isDepleted`\r\n- Rewrite the `getStatus` function to compute the status dynamically (based on `block.timestamp`)\r\n\r\nHere's the new enum:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nenum Status {\r\n    PENDING,\r\n    STREAMING,\r\n    SETTLED,\r\n    CANCELED,\r\n    DEPLETED\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Diagrams\r\n\r\n|    Before    |     After    |\r\n| :----------: | :----------: |\r\n|  ![Before](https://i.imgur.com/n9LXrGN.png)  |  ![After](https://i.postimg.cc/sfHsBkWB/mermaid-diagram-2023-04-25-190035.png)  |","createdAt":"2023-04-25T16:05:35Z","labels":[],"number":459,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Status enum is overly simplistic","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-05-14T17:12:56Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/459"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"As @IaroslavMazur pointed out in his audit report conducted in March 2023, the name of this custom error is long:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/2b71d0762706ad04cdad58e37d2c6db0b6274496/src/libraries/Errors.sol#L82-L84\r\n\r\nHe suggested renaming the error to `AmountTooBig`, but I did not like this wording because it can easily be confused with something else, e.g. an overflow, so I ended up brushing the issue aside.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I have stumbled upon the term \"overdraw\", which is perfect given the context of the withdraw function; let me show you the definition from [Cambridge Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/overdraw):\r\n\r\n> to take more money out of your bank account than the account contains\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should rename the error like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nerror SablierV2Lockup_Overdraw\r\n```","createdAt":"2023-04-25T11:58:00Z","labels":[],"number":458,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Shorten name of `WithdrawAmountGreaterThanWithdrawableAmount` error","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-05-14T15:57:06Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/458"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The `renounce` functions allows settled streams to be renounced:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/2b71d0762706ad04cdad58e37d2c6db0b6274496/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L147-L155\r\n\r\nBut this is a pointless operation, because settled streams cannot be canceled anymore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/2b71d0762706ad04cdad58e37d2c6db0b6274496/src/SablierV2LockupLinear.sol#L370-L372","createdAt":"2023-04-24T13:37:33Z","labels":[],"number":457,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Settled streams should not be renounceable","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-05-14T16:03:50Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/457"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The `_withdrawableAmountOf` implementations in `SablierV2LockupLinear` and `SablierV2LockupDynamic` can be moved to the `SablierV2Lockup` abstract.","createdAt":"2023-04-24T08:45:35Z","labels":[],"number":455,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Dedup `_withdrawableAmountOf`","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-05-14T16:03:46Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/455"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Since https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/pull/451, our number of external dependencies has grown to *nine*.

The user will choose an entity: a stream by id, an airstream by id or an account.

Therefore, my proposal is to use libraries to group the structs according to the contract where they are needed.\r\n\r\n### Structs\r\n\r\n- [x] Group `Amounts` and `CreateAmounts` under a `Lockup` library\r\n- [x] Group `Durations`, `LockupLinear`, and `Range` under a `LockupLinear` library\r\n- [x] Group `LockupPro` and `Segment` under `LockupPro`\r\n    - [x] Also add a `Range` struct to encapsulate the `startTime` and the `endTime` in the pro struct\r\n\r\n### Enum Problem\r\n\r\nThe plan above works well for structs, but what about the the `Status` enum?\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, we would be able to define it under another `Lockup` library, like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary Lockup {\r\n    enum Status {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, we can't do this because there would be a naming collision with the `Lockup` structs' library. We also can't have a \"grandparent\" namespace with Solidity libraries:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary Enums {\r\n    library Lockup {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause nested libraries are not allowed in Solidity.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left with a couple of solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Define the `Status` enum under `Lockup`, and rename the `Structs.sol` file to `StructsAndEnums.sol` or `Types.sol` or `DataTypes.sol`. This is exactly what Aave V3 [did](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/b007d1ee29ad2e6d9f2eb7459acb98a40855dbd5/contracts/protocol/libraries/types/DataTypes.sol).\r\n2.

These are the idea we had:\r\n\r\n- `Lockup`\r\n- `CapitalLockup`\r\n- `ClosedEnded`\r\n- `ClosedEndedLockup`\r\n- `CE` (as in, \"Closed Ended\")\r\n- `Closed`\r\n- `Vesting` (though I know @razgraf doesn't like to reference any particular use case in the contract name)\r\n\r\nThe `Linear` and the `Pro` suffixes could be optionally shortened to `L` and `P`, respectively.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the variant I like the most is `Lockup` because it captures the current logic of creating streams quite accurately. \"Lockup\" as a term [is used in traditional finance in vesting contexts](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/lock-up-vesting), as well as in crypto (see [Near's post](https://wiki.near.org/getting-started/near-token/lockups)).\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the issue with `ClosedEnded` is that it doesn't indicate to users that they have to make a one-time deposit in order for the stream to start. In principle, a stream could be closed-ended while being lockup-free, allowing users to top up.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, an open-ended stream must necessarily be lockup-free, because a payment rate per second cannot be calculated from a fixed deposit without a stop time. From this perspective, `ClosedEnded` would be a better prefix, because it would mirror the `OpenEnded` prefix we would presumably use for what we currently call [`SablierV2Payroll`](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-payroll/).\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I tend to favor `Lockup`, but if we agree that we will never build a closed-ended contract that is lockup-free and has top ups, then `ClosedEnded` would also be a good fit.</div>","createdAt":"2023-01-12T11:20:03Z","labels":[],"number":261,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Rename \"SablierV2Linear\" to \"SablierV2LockupLinear\" and \"SablierV2Pro\" to \"SablierV2LockupPro\"","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-01-24T18:29:02Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/261"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The current scripts produce non-deterministic contracts addresses between different chains.\n\nBut it would be nice to have the contracts deployed at the same addresses on all chains.\n\nFor that, we can use Micah's [deterministic-deployment-proxy](https://github.com/Zoltu/deterministic-deployment-proxy), which is like a universal factory contract that uses CREATE2.","createdAt":"2023-01-11T08:15:56Z","labels":[],"number":260,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Update scripts to use the deterministic-deployment-proxy","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-01-18T10:01:58Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/260"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Bug Report\r\n\r\nOne of the protocol invariants is that it is not possible to withdraw more than has been deposited in a stream, but this invariant can be currently broken by passing a low-enough negative exponent in one of the segments used for creating a pro stream.\r\n\r\nI wrote a test that proves this - you can add the following in the [`GetWithdrawableAmount__ProTest`](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/d9fffa978da342785be2bd3b5899a803e6b0a212/test/unit/sablier-v2/pro/get-withdrawable-amount/getWithdrawableAmount.t.sol) test contract and see that the test fails:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction test_NegativeExponent() external {\r\n    Segment[] memory segments = DEFAULT_SEGMENTS;\r\n    SD1x18 exponent = SD1x18.wrap(type(int64).min);\r\n    segments[0].exponent = exponent;\r\n\r\n    uint256 streamId = createDefaultStreamWithSegments(segments);\r\n\r\n    vm.warp({ timestamp: DEFAULT_START_TIME + DEFAULT_TIME_WARP / 2 });\r\n\r\n    uint128 withdrawableAmount = pro.getWithdrawableAmount(streamId);\r\n    assertLte(withdrawableAmount, DEFAULT_NET_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added logs and this is what I saw:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nmultiplier           416300391087773904283\r\ncurrentSegmentAmount 2500000000000000000000\r\nproRataAmount        1040750977719434760707500\r\nstreamedAmount       1040750977719434760707500\r\nwithdrawableAmount   1040750977719434760707500\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn English, the above means that the calculated `withdrawableAmount` is ~1,040,750.97 tokens, whereas the current segment deposit is ~2,500 tokens (and, for that matter, the deposit amount is 10,000 tokens).\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I have recently added an [assert](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/d9fffa978da342785be2bd3b5899a803e6b0a212/src/SablierV2Pro.sol#L519) in the `_withdraw` function that prevented an attacker from exploiting this. However, there was no such assertion in the cancel function, so the attacker could have just canceled the stream and walk away with *all* the money from the pro contract.\r\n\r\n## Mathematical Explanation\r\n\r\nI will refer to the `_calculateWithdrawableAmountForOneSegment` function in this section, but the same rationale applies to the calculations made in the `_calculateWithdrawableAmountForMultipleSegments`.\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple - when raising a sub-unitary base to a *negative* sub-unitary exponent, the result is always supra-unitary (greater than 1).\r\n\r\nIn our code, we have the following (castings removed for brevity):\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nSD59x18 elapsedTimePercentage = elapsedTime.div(totalTime);\r\nSD59x18 multiplier = elapsedTimePercentage.pow(exponent);\r\nSD59x18 streamedAmount = multiplier.mul(depositAmount);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n\r\n- `elapsedTimePercentage` is always sub-unitary, since it's the result of dividing a number (`elapsedTime`) that is always smaller than the divisor (`totalTime`)\r\n- `exponent` is a user input and so it can be made negative by the user. Maximum exploiting benefits can be derived by setting it to `type(int64).min).\r\n\r\nTherefore, `multiplier` ends up being supra-unitary, and `streamedAmount` greater than `depositAmount`.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to fix this bug:\r\n\r\n1. We switch to the [`UD2x18`](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math/blob/dae7d325eaf97b2bc5364e8e9977f399ef4f63bc/src/UD2x18.sol) type instead of `SD1x18`, which would automatically forbid negative values.\r\n2. We keep `SD1x18` but add a `>= 0` check.\r\n\r\nI'm in favor of the first solution since it would involve writing less code - we wouldn't have to add tests that checks that no segment is negative. The only cost is that we will have to allow bigger exponents (up to 18.446744073709551615), but this shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\n## Future Prevention\r\n\r\nFirst, we should add more assertions in the code.

Specifically, in the successful function execution paths, both of the following conditions must pass:\r\n\r\n1. The amounts must add up to the net deposit amount.\r\n2. The milestones must be ordered.\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to fuzz the arrays during the development of #220, I ended up giving up because I was getting too many test rejects, and also the test runs were unbearably slow (though I can't remember if that was, in part, caused by the activation of via IR).\r\n\r\nHere's a GitHub Gist with quick sort algorithm I wrote back then, which might be handy when we pick this task up again:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/paulrberg/61e5a90434bd4bad31d9dbe9dd0c500e","createdAt":"2023-01-07T22:08:08Z","labels":[],"number":256,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Fuzz segments in pro tests","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-02-10T21:42:14Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/256"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The idea is to take the `getWithdrawableAmount` function and rename it to `getStreamedAmount`, and then write up a new `getWithdrawableAmount` that simply calls `getStreamedAmount` and subtracts the withdrawn amount.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\n1. Consistency with the marketing approach. We're marketing ourselves as a streaming protocol, yet we don't have any function that returns the amount streamed so far.\r\n2.

The other problem is that this eats into our Alchemy bill, which means that the current set-up is not sustainable at all.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe integration tests are the culprit - the core problem must be the fact that there are a lot of API queries made to Alchemy. The cache implemented in #182 doesn't help much because of the fuzzing. Therefore, what we have to do is follow the following advice from the Foundry Book's [Best Practices](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/best-practices#fork-tests):\r\n\r\n> Be careful with with fuzz tests on a fork to avoid burning through RPC requests with non-deterministic fuzzing. If the input to your fork fuzz test is some parameter which is used in an RPC call to fetch data (e.g. querying the token balance of an address), each run of a fuzz test uses at least 1 RPC request, so you'll quickly hit rate limits or usage limits. Solutions to consider:\r\n> - Replace multiple RPC calls with a single [multicall](https://github.com/mds1/multicall).\r\n> - Specify a fuzz/invariant [seed](https://book.getfoundry.sh/src/reference/config/testing.html#seed): this makes sure each forge test invocation uses the same fuzz inputs. RPC results are cached locally, so you'll only query the node the first time.\r\n> - Structure your tests so the data you are fuzzing over is computed locally by your contract, and not data that is used in an RPC call (may or may not be feasible based on what you're doing).\r\n> - Lastly, you can of course always run a local node or bump your RPC plan.","createdAt":"2022-12-31T18:26:15Z","labels":[],"number":233,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Lower the CI run times","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-02-14T17:06:28Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/233"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"Just like #230 but for `SD59x18.wrap` and `toSD59x18` in the `SablierV2Pro` contract.","createdAt":"2022-12-31T12:23:37Z","labels":[],"number":231,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Use \"SD59x18.wrap\" instead of \"toSD59x18\" in \"getWithdrawableAmount\"","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-01-05T13:27:27Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/231"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"We are currently scaling up the `elapsedTime` and the `totalTime` to have 18 decimals by using the `toUD60x18` conversion function from PRBMath:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/blob/aeb6f4c1ff2102753cd898c015b7480aa9b9bff2/src/SablierV2Linear.sol#L117-L119\r\n\r\nBut this is not necessary. If we used `UD60x18.wrap` instead, like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nUD60x18 elapsedTime = UD60x18.wrap(currentTime - startTime);\r\nUD60x18 totalTime = UD60x18.wrap(stopTime - startTime);\r\nUD60x18 elapsedTimePercentage = elapsedTime.div(totalTime);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe calculations would be completely equivalent, i.e. `elapsedTimePercentage` would have the exact same value. The reason is arithmetics - even if `elapsedTime` and `totalTime` are not scaled up to have 18 decimals, the `div` calculation would still work, thanks to the laws of arithmetics.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to see why with an example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n\r\nfunction foo(\r\n    uint40 currentTime,\r\n    uint40 startTime,\r\n    uint40 stopTime\r\n) external pure returns (UD60x18 elapsedTime, UD60x18 totalTime, UD60x18 elapsedTimePercentage) {\r\n    elapsedTime = toUD60x18(currentTime - startTime);\r\n    totalTime = toUD60x18(stopTime - startTime);\r\n    elapsedTimePercentage = elapsedTime.div(totalTime);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction bar(\r\n    uint40 currentTime,\r\n    uint40 startTime,\r\n    uint40 stopTime\r\n) external pure returns (UD60x18 elapsedTime, UD60x18 totalTime, UD60x18 elapsedTimePercentage) {\r\n    elapsedTime = UD60x18.wrap(currentTime - startTime);\r\n    totalTime = UD60x18.wrap(stopTime - startTime);\r\n    elapsedTimePercentage = elapsedTime.div(totalTime);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you pass the following input to this function:\r\n\r\n- `currentTime`: 1672488200\r\n- `startTime`: 1672448200\r\n- `stopTime`: 1672568200\r\n\r\nYou would get the same result in either case, i.e. 333333333333333333, which in natural numbers is 0.333333333333333333. The only thing different would be the raw values of `elapsedTime` and `totalTime`, which would be the following in the first case:\r\n\r\n- `elapsedTime`: 40000 (0.00000000000004 in natural numbers)\r\n- `totalTime`: 120000 (0.00000000000012 in natural numbers)\r\n\r\nAnd the following in the second case:\r\n\r\n- `elapsedTime`: 40000000000000000000000 (40000 in natural numbers)\r\n- `totalTime`: 120000000000000000000000 (120000 in natural numbers)\r\n\r\nFinally, if you are to check the following equation on [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/):\r\n\r\n```\r\n(0.00000000000004 / 0.00000000000012) == 40000 / 120000\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would see that it returns \"True\".","createdAt":"2022-12-31T12:22:14Z","labels":[],"number":230,"repository":"sablier-labs/lockup","state":"closed","title":"Use \"UD60x18.wrap\" instead of \"toUD60x18\" in \"getWithdrawableAmount\"","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-01-05T13:27:26Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/lockup/issues/230"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"The currents tests for the `cancel` function don't include the case when there have been withdrawals.

It can be either (i) a percentage fee (as I have proposed above) or (ii) an actual token amount, due to be calculated by the client.\r\n\r\nI have decided to go with the former (option (i)) because of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The gas costs are similar anyway, because there would still have to be a check for the fee amount to not be greater than some pre-defined value. Dividing the fee amount by the deposit amount and then checking against some value is equivalent to checking that the fee percentage is smaller than that value and then calculating the fee amount based on the percentage.\r\n2. Using a percentage fee is consistent with the logic of the [protocol fees](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math#usage), which are also percentages.\r\n3. Using a percentage fee is a bit more scalable, because we are demanding less from the caller.

In short, the idea is that ill-intended recipients can transfer the NFT to a contract that performs a never-ending computation (e.g. [this contract](https://gist.github.com/PaulRBerg/6b91f46ba7ba50470243f17cf7362f74). After a few hours of debugging, the \"vulnerability\" turned out to be a false alarm for the protocol (you should have received an email from me). However, there is an implication for the UI.\r\n\r\nWhen the sender attempts to cancel a stream whose recipient is a DoS contract, the wallet software will shoot up the estimated gas price to the maximum block gas limit:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/assets/8782666/e5c884d3-f510-4068-ae93-61af982cac9f\"/>\r\n\r\nNow, the catch is that the transaction _will succeed_, even if the gas limit need not be that high.

However, the wording can be slimmed down.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nMaking the proxy explicit and referencing it everywhere is problematic:\r\n\r\n1. First and foremost: it adds cognitive load onto non-technical users. Rather than focusing on educating these users on the nature of lockup streaming (which is a difficult thing to do, anyway!), we are also giving them homework on proxies. And this is a tall ask - I know Solidity developers who grapple with the forwarding proxy design.\r\n2. Stuffing the app with proxy references makes it more difficult to use and understand:\r\n     - When searching streams, how are users supposed to find the proxy address of a particular EOA? Go to Etherscan and call `getProxy`? People know about EOAs, not proxies.\r\n     - When recipients open the app, they see an alien address streaming tokens to them instead of the typical address they thought their payer had\r\n3.  The term \"proxy\" refers to different technical designs in Ethereum, and people dunk on most of them [^1]\r\n    - Unfortunately for us, the \"upgradeable proxy\" is the most popular type of proxy, which means that some Sablier users (many?) may be misled into considering Sablier an upgradeable protocol\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. In the subgraph, normalize the streams so that proxy-originating streams are added to the EOA's list of streams\r\n    - Add an ancillary property for tracking the proxy that created the stream, which is null when the sender creates streams directly\r\n    - Optionally, add a boolean `rawSender`\r\n2. In general: display only EOAs regardless of whether the raw sender (in V2 Core) is the EOA's proxy\r\n3. In the search view: allow search by EOA only.\r\n4. For every sender action, check the raw sender;\r\n    - If `sender == proxy`: call V2 Periphery via proxy\r\n    - If `sender != proxy`: call V2 Core directly\r\n5. Keep mentioning the proxy in the wallet modal (but not the wallet button), as well as in various informational tooltips.\r\n\r\n## Concluding Remarks\r\n\r\nThere will be challenges in any case, but abstracting away the proxy may come with fewer downsides compared to making it glaringly explicit.\r\n\r\nBesides the refactoring cost, the only challenge introduced by my suggested solution would be one of *reverse synchronization* with the crypto ecosystem. People may look on Etherscan, see the raw sender (i.e., the proxy), open the Sablier UI, and try to search by that proxy address assuming that it is a direct user.\r\n\r\nHowever: (i) these are read-only users, and (ii) these are external users, and (iii) reverse lookups should be rare.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://twitter.com/optimizoor/status/1671648226439741442</div>","createdAt":"2023-06-26T21:14:03Z","labels":["priority: 1"],"number":486,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Abstract away the proxy (show the raw sender address instead)","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-06-30T11:49:35Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/486"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"This is a meta issue that includes all discussions and smaller issues that stemmed from #274.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] Based on #274 replace the stream **alias** system (in both v2-interfaces and v2-subgraphs) with the `LL-<chainId>-<tokenId>` and `LD-<chainId>-<tokenId>` schemas\r\n   - Related: keep them uppercase if possible\r\n- [x] Based on #274 replace titles including \"[Category]\" with \"Lockup [Category]\"\r\n- [x] Based on #274 handle individual cases using the rules as much as possible (but situationally adapt where necessary)\r\n- [x] Based on #456 try to capitalize the usage of stream categories (i.e. **\"L**ockup **L**inear or **D**ynamic) \r\n- [ ] Based on #427 refactor the Transaction Modal descriptions to use capitalized terms and prevent repetition of the \"stream\" particle\r\n- [x] Based on #428 refactor the label from the 3rd column of the dashboard table to say \"Linear\" / \"Dynamic\" and \"Cliff of X\" while the label on the 1st column (above stream status) will mention the shorter stream `id`","createdAt":"2023-06-26T18:05:29Z","labels":["priority: 1"],"number":484,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Include the `lockup` prefix in identifiers and titles (Meta Issue)","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-06-30T11:54:30Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/484"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"### Discussed in https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/discussions/416\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **PaulRBerg** June 20, 2023</sup>\r\nThe FAQ on the landing page looks awesome, and I appreciate the effort put into building it.

We are now explicitly checking for overlapping methods when installing plugins:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy/pull/121\r\n\r\n## Steps for Repro\r\n\r\n1. Deploy a proxy without using the Sablier UI, e.g., via Etherscan's [Write contract](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xa87bc4c1bc54e1c1b28d2dd942a094a6b665b8c9#writeContract) feature\r\n2. Install a plugin containing a method that collides with Sablier's `onStreamCanceled`, e.g. [`onAddictionFeesRefunded`](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy/blob/06360442359e0810ec914c133e53d7daf046ef71/test/mocks/plugins/PluginCollider.sol#L15C14-L15C37)\r\n3. Go to the client app\r\n4. Attempt to create a stream\r\n5. The tx will not be allowed by the UI because of a plugin address mismatch (ref https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/issues/397)\r\n6. The \"Manage proxy\" modal will appear\r\n7. The `installPlugin` tx will revert with a [`PRBProxyRegistry_PluginMethodCollision`](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy/blob/2fc7d99dc9a2debe8a014b81490d6095a67ce9d4/src/interfaces/IPRBProxyRegistry.sol#L24C11-L26) error\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's no easy fix. We would have to ask the user to sign two separate transactions:\r\n\r\n- Uninstall the (malicious) plugin\r\n- Install the genuine plugin\r\n\r\nHowever, the good news is that method collisions are rare, and malicious plugins may do something more overt like stealing the ERC-20 assets right away (rather than attempting this sophisticated attack with a method collision).\r\n\r\nSo, a more pragmatic solution would be this:\r\n\r\n1. Call the new getter `getPluginByOwner` on the proxy registry\r\n2. If the result is `address(0)`, run the \"Manage proxy\" modal as usual\r\n3. If the result is not the zero address, check if the address is a known Sablier plugin.\r\n4. If the address is not a known Sablier plugin, tell the user to ask for help on Discord, and hide the \"Manage proxy\" modal. Alternatively, show this warning in the \"Manage proxy\" modal itself, but block the submit button.\r\n\r\nVery very few users will arrive at step 4, so we should be able to brush this scenario aside (in the short term).","createdAt":"2023-06-26T08:43:42Z","labels":["type: bug","backlog"],"number":472,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Implement UI module for re-installing a plugin in the proxy","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-12-19T23:37:12Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/472"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"I've recently changed the `Ignore Build Step` configuration on Vercel to stop any builds from happening there.

The status is checked by every single state-changing function in the contracts, and the NFT features it [prominently](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/520) as one of the four cards included in the SVG.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the UI, the stream status does not get the attention it deserves; it's missing from the right-hand view in the stream profile:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-24 at 3 17 42 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/assets/8782666/b5a868d1-1d75-45bc-93d0-a8eb27feecbb\">\r\n\r\nOnly below this, there's the simulation card that gives some _indirect_ information about the status:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-24 at 3 30 03 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/assets/8782666/051ecb5e-097c-4b41-8449-0f7fb330fa93\">\r\n\r\nBut this is for settled streams. For streaming streams, the status is not made explicit - it only says that \"The stream will end\".\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- Making the status explicit would also help our ecosystem of integrators - because the status will be a critical piece of data that any integrator will use in determining the current value of a stream, its vendibility, etc.\r\n- On 13-inch devices like my MacBook Air, the simulation card does not appear without scrolling first ([screenshot](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/assets/8782666/f9bb7c60-3dd2-4da7-9bbe-76b940a979d7)).\r\n- Separately, how about renaming the subtitle from \"Details\" to \"Attributes\"?

There's been a consistent error I've made in the beginning (I realized a while back) where variables that were passed as arguments have been marked as optional, when in fact they were expected - just that they could be undefined as well.\n\nSmall example: in a guard function, we may require `chainId` and revert if it doesn't exist. Typing the props with `?` would help us achieve the verification (chainId would be regarded as possibly `undefined`), although the intention wouldn't be represented quite right (we're expecting the chainId in the arguments, just not with a valid value at all times).\n\n```ts\ninterface A { chainId?: number }\ninterface B { chainId: number | undefined }\n```\n\nWe should do a soft \"review\" of the codebase and refactor these cases.\n\n\n---\n\n**Some examples**\n\n- [ ] form contexts (values should be `string | undefined`)","createdAt":"2023-06-17T10:28:18Z","labels":["backlog","priority: 2"],"number":400,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Convert `?` into `x | undefined` when NIL was expected instead of optionality","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-12-20T00:04:58Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/400"},{"author":"PaulRBerg","body":"## Description\r\n\r\nA recurrent theme in Cantina's recent audit report is the inescapable insecurity of proxy plugins[^1][^2] - they can never be trusted to be 100% safe.\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing these audit findings, I realized that the preceding fact has security implications for the client app. That is, our UI should not _assume_ that the proxy plugin associated with the `onStreamCanceled` method is our genuine plugin. Instead, the UI should perform a bytecode check. Specifically, it should load the bytecode of the on-chain resolved plugin (via [`getCode`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/single-page/#/v5/api/providers/provider/-%23-Provider-getCode)?), and compare it against a local, hard-coded bytecode. And if there is a mismatch, the user should not be allowed to create streams (this would be analogous to the sanction modal, I guess).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- Situations like this should be rare, but it's better to be safe than sorry.\r\n- Because this should be rare, there's no need to provide functionality for uninstalling the malicious plugin; a simple, informational message explaining that the user ought to double-check their proxy plugins would suffice (for now).\r\n- At the moment, the periphery contracts' bytecode has to be generated manually with Forge, but in the future, we will provide hard-coded values in the repo itself[^3].\r\n\r\n## Alternative Idea\r\n\r\nWe could also consider listing the `SablierV2ProxyPlugin` contract in the `SablierV2Archive` contract (although this would be a bit recursive since the former contains an on-chain reference to the latter), and the UI could perform an on-chain check, i.e., `archive.isListed(resolvedProxyPlugin)`.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://github.com/cantinasec/review-sablier2/issues/13\r\n[^2]: https://github.com/cantinasec/review-sablier2/issues/19\r\n[^3]: https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/issues/67","createdAt":"2023-06-16T22:06:04Z","labels":["priority: 2"],"number":397,"repository":"sablier-labs/interfaces","state":"closed","title":"Check that the proxy plugin address is actually the correct one","type":"issue","updatedAt":"2023-06-26T08:23:29Z","url":"https://github.com/sablier-labs/interfaces/issues/397"},{"author":"razgraf","body":"### Discussed in https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-interfaces/discussions/52\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **PaulRBerg** October 16, 2022</sup>\r\nI just started looking at the `tsconfig.json` and it's hard for me to contrast and compare the differences between them, because the keys are not ordered alphabetically in all files.\r\n\r\nLuckily there is a Prettier plugin that can do this for us, [`pretiter-plugin-sort-json`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-sort-json).\r\n\r\nWould you be happy to start using it in this repo, @razgraf?

I've spent a few hours debugging this and couldn't figure it out. It's not worth it to continue at this point.\r\n- But, given that the error log mention `styled-components`, something seems to be awry with that. It's possibly that importing the `@sablier/utils` package fools Next.js into importing other `styled-components`-related types, or the `styled-components` package itself (although it's not listed as a dependency, so it's strange ..).
